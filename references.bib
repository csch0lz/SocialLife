	abstract = {Purpose In the field of public relations and communication management, message evaluation has been one of the starting points for evaluation and measurement research at least since the 1970s. Reliable and valid message evaluation has a central role in message effects research and campaign design in other disciplines as well as communication science. The purpose of this paper is to offer a message testing protocol to efficiently acquire valid and reliable message evaluation data. Design/methodology/approach A message testing protocol is described in terms of how to conceptualize and evaluate the content and format of messages, in terms of procedures for acquiring and testing messages and in terms of using efficient, reliable and valid measures of perceived message effectiveness ({PME}) and perceived argument strength ({PAS}). The evidence supporting the reliability and validity of {PME} and {PAS} measures is reviewed. Findings The message testing protocol developed and reported is an efficient, reliable and valid approach for testing large numbers of messages. Research limitations/implications Researchers’ ability to select candidate messages for subsequent deeper testing, for various types of communication campaigns, and for research in theory testing contexts is facilitated. Avoiding the limitations of using a single instance of a message to represent a category (also known as the case-category confound) is reduced. Practical implications Communication campaign designers are armed with tools to assess messages and campaign concepts quickly and efficiently, reducing pre-testing time and resources while identifying “best-in-show” examples and prototypes. Originality/value Message structures are conceptualized in terms of content and format features using theoretically driven constructs. Measures of {PAS} and {PME} are reviewed for their reliability, construct and predictive validity, finding that the measures are acceptable surrogates for actual effectiveness for a wide variety of messages and applications. Coupled with procedures that reduce confounding by randomly nesting messages within respondents and respondents to messages, the measures used and protocol deployed offer an efficient and utilitarian approach to message testing and modeling.},

	abstract = {Successful prevention programs depend on a complex interplay among aspects of the intervention, the participant, the specific intervention setting, and the broader set of contexts with which a participant interacts. There is a need to theorize what happens as participants bring intervention ideas and behaviors into other life-contexts, and theory has not yet specified how social interactions about interventions may influence outcomes. To address this gap, we use an ecological perspective to develop the social interface model. This paper presents the key components of the model and its potential to aid the design and implementation of prevention interventions. The model is predicated on the idea that intervention message effectiveness depends not only on message aspects but also on the participants’ adoption and adaptation of the message vis-à-vis their social ecology. The model depicts processes by which intervention messages are received and enacted by participants through social processes occurring within and between relevant microsystems. Mesosystem interfaces (negligible interface, transference, co-dependence, and interdependence) can facilitate or detract from intervention effects. The social interface model advances prevention science by theorizing that practitioners can create better quality interventions by planning for what occurs after interventions are delivered.},

Using the cross-sectional survey (N = 224), a path analysis was run to examine the mediated moderation effects of narrative engagement (e.g., interest, realism, and identification with main characters) and peer communication about the intervention videos (e.g., frequency and valence of communication) on adolescent refusal self-efficacy and substance use behaviors. Results revealed that realism was significantly related to adolescent refusal self-efficacy and frequent peer communication moderated the association between refusal self-efficacy and the past 30-day marijuana use.

The present study used surveys to explore how Nicaraguan adolescents who participated in a school-based substance use and violence prevention intervention communicated about the intervention with parents, peers, and teachers. Latent class analysis was run to identify distinctive typologies of interfaces characterized by occurrence and importance of conversations. Five latent classes (N = 109) were discovered: optimal transference (21\%), neutral transference (17\%), limited positive transference (17\%), negligible neutral interface (28\%), and negligible adverse interface (16\%). The optimal transference and neutral transference groups reported having conversations with all three microsystems (i.e. their mother, father, best friend, and teachers) and that those conversations resulted in seeing the curriculum the same way or as more important. The negligible neutral interface and negligible adverse interface groups reported minimal or no conversation across microsystems, which resulted in viewing the curriculum as not important or less important. The limited positive transference group reported selective conversations mostly with their mother and teachers, which was evaluated as important and/or neutral. Findings discuss the application of {SIM} in prevention research and provide a more nuanced understanding of how intervention messages are recalled and processed post-delivery.},

We report three experiments (N = 1,264 U.S.-based adults) demonstrating that people’s interest in discussing important but potentially divisive topics is guided by their expectations about how positively the conversation will unfold, leaving them more interested in having a conversation with someone who agrees versus disagrees with them. People’s expectations about their conversations, however, were systematically miscalibrated such that people underestimated how positive these conversations would be—especially in cases of disagreement. Miscalibrated expectations stemmed from underestimating the degree of common ground that would emerge in conversation and from failing to appreciate the power of social forces in conversation that create social connection. Misunderstanding the outcomes of conversation could lead people to avoid discussing disagreements more often, creating a misplaced barrier to learning, social connection, free inquiry, and free expression.},

	abstract = {Background: Social interactions require rapid, real-time information integration and performative application of dynamic social information, and can be especially difficult for patients with schizophrenia. Their difficulty processing social information could lie in challenges extracting the information or in updating their actions to accommodate the new information, resulting in behaviors that may appear rigid or inappropriate. Disruptions may emerge in the underlying, requisite behavioral or neural processes. 
Methods: Seventeen matched healthy controls and seventeen patients with schizophrenia participated in an {fMRI} study, which included a social interaction priming procedure wherein they met a friendly stranger who held opposite social values from their own. They answered self-judgement questions about their social values two days before the priming experiment and again during the {fMRI} scan. 
Results: Controls suppress social values when interacting with the stranger whereas patients with schizophrenia augment the opposite values, simultaneously holding two sets of social values. Compared to controls, patients display hyperactivity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and atypical activity in caudate, posterior cingulate and precuneus. 
Discussion: Patients appear to correctly extract social information but apply the information atypically. They display evidence of atypical social flexibility on both performative and neural measures, resulting in confusion between self and other.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Many quantitative cross-cultural research studies assume that cultural groups consist of anyone born and raised in the same country. Applying these criteria to the formation of study samples may produce cohorts that share a country but are heterogeneous in relevant domains of culture. For example, in Canada, Franco- and Anglo-Canadians are generally assumed to represent different linguistic groups but the same cultural group. However, speaking a different first language also can mean exposure to different media, information, and conventions, which are known to shape certain cultural domains, such as social values. Other factors may also produce cultural heterogeneity. For example, ancestral origins and recency of familial migration may influence endorsed social values after exposure to diverse cultures or norms. Mental health status or psychiatric conditions may also influence subscription of social values due to different lifestyle demands. Understanding the nuanced contributions of diverse backgrounds to cultural membership and fit (i.e., the degree to which an individual behaves like other cultural members) is useful when performing quantitative cross-cultural studies to minimize alternative explanations for statistical outcomes. This study used Cultural Consensus Analysis ({CCA}) to assess the cultural fit of social values for 222 Canadians, who had participated in cross-cultural neuropsychological experiments. {CCA} is an anthropological statistical method for evaluating cultural agreement of a sample. Participants were systematically evaluated by linguistic groups (French and English), migratory generation (1st–3rd+), and mental health status (healthy and patient). Group and individual variances were statistically interrogated. Results demonstrated that Franco- and Anglo-Canadians represent different cultural groups cohabitating in Quebec. Social values dividing Franco- and Anglo-Canadians were also identified. Second and third generation Canadians held more heterogeneous social values than Canadians, whose families had migrated earlier. Second generation Canadians with psychiatric disorders showed notably reduced cultural fit with other Canadians, which supports other literature reporting difficulties experienced by second generation migrants. However, third and later generations of Canadians with psychiatric disorders held a greater range of social values compared to healthy Canadians but still were good fits for Canadian culture. This study concluded that linguistic group and migratory generation partially determines cultural group for the social values domain while mental health status does not, contrary to theories proposed by previous literature.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The political landscape in the {US} and many other countries is characterized by policy impasses and animosity between rival political groups. Research finds that these divisions are fueled in part by disparate moral concerns and convictions that undermine communication and understanding between liberals and conservatives. This “moral empathy gap” is particularly evident in the moral underpinnings of the political arguments members of each side employ when trying to persuade one another. Both liberals and conservatives typically craft arguments based on their own moral convictions rather than the convictions of the people they target for persuasion. As a result, these moral arguments tend to be unpersuasive, even offensive, to their recipients. The technique of moral reframing—whereby a position an individual would not normally support is framed in a way that is consistent with that individual's moral values—can be an effective means for political communication and persuasion. Over the last decade, studies of moral reframing have shown its effectiveness across a wide range of polarized topics, including views of economic inequality, environmental protection, same-sex marriage, and major party candidates for the {US} presidency. In this article, we review the moral reframing literature, examining potential mediators and moderators of the effect, and discuss important questions that remain unanswered about this phenomenon.},

Almost half of the sample reported a false memory for at least one fabricated event, with more than one third of participants reporting a specific memory of the event. “Yes” voters (those in favor of legalizing abortion) were more likely than “no” voters to “remember” a fabricated scandal regarding the campaign to vote “no,” and “no” voters were more likely than “yes” voters to “remember” a fabricated scandal regarding the campaign to vote “yes.” This difference was particularly strong for voters of low cognitive ability. A subsequent warning about possible misinformation slightly reduced rates of false memories but did not eliminate these effects. This study suggests that voters in a real-world political campaign are most susceptible to forming false memories for fake news that aligns with their beliefs, in particular if they have low cognitive ability.},

Therefore, an ecologically valid approach to studying the psychological and neural mechanisms of social emotions is to elicit and measure them in social interactive contexts, where relevant adaptive goals and functions are salient. However, multiple psychological and neurocognitive processes might be simultaneously activated during real-time social interactions: traditional observation-based tasks and self-report measures alone are not sufficient to capture and dissociate these processes. In this Perspective, we draw on Marr’s levels-of-analysis framework to argue that a holistic consideration of the goals and functions of a social emotion (computation level), formal modelling of its underlying cognitive operations (algorithm level), and neuroscientific measures of the biological bases of these cognitive operations (implementation level) will afford the theoretical frameworks and methodological tools necessary to advance understanding of social emotions. To support this argument, we describe research that showcases the utility of creative combinations of interactive tasks, neural and behavioural measures, and computational modelling for advancing understanding of how social emotions arise and achieve their adaptive goals and functions.},

The authors analyzed neural signals during ad exposure from three functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data sets (113 participants from two countries watching 85 video ads) with automated meta-analytic decoding (Neurosynth). These brain-based measures of psychological processes—including perception and language (information processing), executive function and memory (cognitive functions), and social cognition and emotion (social-affective response)—predicted subsequent self-report ad liking, with emotion and memory being the earliest predictors after the first three seconds. Over the span of ad exposure, while the predictiveness of emotion peaked early and fell, that of social cognition had a peak-and-stable pattern, followed by a late peak of predictiveness in perception and executive function. At the aggregate level, neural signals—especially those associated with social-affective response—improved the prediction of out-of-sample ad liking compared with traditional anatomically based neuroimaging analysis and self-report liking. Finally, early-onset social-affective response predicted population ad liking in a behavioral replication. Overall, this study helps delineate the psychological mechanisms underlying ad processing and ad liking and proposes a novel neuroscience-based approach for generating psychological insights and improving out-of-sample predictions.},

As the magnitude and direction of consumers’ response to {CM} are inconclusive, this meta-analysis synthesizes evidence on main and moderator effects from 237 studies. On average, the authors find a moderate effect for attitudinal response (d = .458) and a weak effect for behavioral response (d = .283; both ps {\textless} .001), both with high underlying heterogeneity. A multivariate meta-regression on {CM} moderators grounded along four conceptual pillars—transparency, signals of sincerity, purchase context, and consumers’ emotional attachment to {CM}—shows that attitudinal effects hinge mostly on emotional attachment. Suboptimal execution and poor communication of the donation appeal in particular can even have detrimental effects on attitudes. In addition, various moderators from other pillars play a relevant role. For behavioral outcomes, both emotional attachment and signals of sincerity are equally important. The visual prominence of the donation is the most relevant individual moderator, with only a few others related to the two pillars following at some distance. Therefore, {CM} requires different priorities depending on corporate objectives. This research further compares the effects of {CM} with those of discounts and other corporate social responsibility marketing instruments, simulates practical examples, and provides avenues for further research.},

	abstract = {The conventional wisdom about negative political campaigning holds that it works, i.e., it has the consequences its practitioners intend. Many observers also fear that negative campaigning has unintended but detrimental effects on the political system itself. An earlier meta-analytic assessment of the relevant literature found no reliable evidence for these claims, but since then the research literature has more than doubled in size and has greatly improved in quality. We reexamine this literature and find that the major conclusions from the earlier meta-analysis still hold. All told, the research literature does not bear out the idea that negative campaigning is an effective means of winning votes, even though it tends to be more memorable and stimulate knowledge about the campaign. Nor is there any reliable evidence that negative campaigning depresses voter turnout, though it does slightly lower feelings of political efficacy, trust in government, and possibly overall public mood.},

Second, we present nine original field experiments that increase the statistical evidence in the literature about the persuasive effects of personal contact tenfold. These experiments’ average effect is also zero. In both existing and our original experiments, persuasive effects only appear to emerge in two rare circumstances. First, when candidates take unusually unpopular positions and campaigns invest unusually heavily in identifying persuadable voters. Second, when campaigns contact voters long before election day and measure effects immediately—although this early persuasion decays.

Typical examples include controlling for posttreatment variables in statistical models, eliminating observations based on posttreatment criteria, or subsetting the data based on posttreatment variables. Though these modeling choices are intended to address common problems encountered when conducting experiments, they can bias estimates of causal effects. Moreover, problems associated with conditioning on posttreatment variables remain largely unrecognized in the field, which we show frequently publishes experimental studies using these practices in our discipline's most prestigious journals. We demonstrate the severity of experimental posttreatment bias analytically and document the magnitude of the potential distortions it induces using visualizations and reanalyses of real-world data.

As expected, college students generally expressed higher levels of interest in anti–alcohol abuse media messages when watching fear appeal than those watching humor appeal. However, college binge drinkers who watched the fear appeal reported lower levels of readiness to change their drinking behavior than those who watched the humor appeal. This pattern was the opposite among college nonbinge drinkers, in that college nonbinge drinkers were more likely to say they would change their drinking behaviors when exposed to fear appeal than those who were exposed to humor appeal or those who did not watch any media messages. Conventional fear appeal to scare college binge drinkers seems ineffective and even counterproductive while humor appeal, if well designed, could offer alternative ways to communicate with college binge drinkers.},

Design/methodology/approach Based on repeated cross-sectional, nationally representative data from the 2011-2014 Annual Survey of Buddhist Lent Campaign Evaluation (N = 10,133), a generalized ordered logit (partial proportional odds) model is used. The outcome of interest is self-reported alcohol consumption during the campaign period, compared to before. The main explanatory variables include exposure to the campaign and exposure to alcohol advertising. Findings Results show that exposure to the campaign and exposure to alcohol advertising positively and negatively influence alcohol consumption, respectively. Compared to those with one type of exposure and those without any exposure to alcohol-related messages, drinkers with exposure to both the campaign and alcohol advertising are estimated to have the highest probability of drinking reduction during the campaign period. Originality/value The paper highlights the importance of accounting for a countervailing force (in this case, alcohol advertising) in campaign evaluation studies. It also suggests that alcohol-control social marketing be continued and that the government should disseminate alcohol-prevention messages in a balanced manner, ensuring that both costs and benefits of alcohol consumption are well-understood by the intended audience.},

	abstract = {Social interactions require fluid self-concepts to adapt to real-time dynamics – in theory. In practice, fluid processes have been difficult to experimentally quantify. Active self-concepts theoretically respond to social contexts while stable self-concepts are context-independent. Such fluctuations in ‘typical’ adults have rarely been reported. Self-concept research has broad implications; inducing and quantifying active fluctuations is long-sought-after in social psychology. However, since their inception, self-concepts were studied using bicultural participants (e.g., cultural priming experiments) and characterized in psychiatric patients (e.g., ‘fragmented self’). By increasing methodological saliency and ecological validity of popular methods, three studies tested an adapted scale and social interaction priming procedure for differentiating between active and stable self-concepts. Psychometrics, reproducibility and clinical relevance are compared to a common measure of bicultural self-concept fluidity using optimized statistics. Pre-Study controls (N=42) characterize repetition effects. Study 1: Active self-concepts are suppressed in convenience sample of 62 W.E.I.R.D. students. Study 2: Diverse, locally-representative and randomly-sampled adults (N=43) replicates Study 1 findings. Study 3: Patients with schizophrenia (N=27) hold opposing self-concepts, adopting their interlocutor’s while keeping their own. Four distinct flexibility phenotypes emerge. These studies are the first to quantify active self-concepts. This article precedes a manuscript series interrogating replicability, neural activations and cultural-clinical implications.},

Their difficulty processing social information could lie in challenges extracting the information or in updating their actions to accommodate the new information, resulting in behaviors that may appear rigid or inappropriate. Disruptions may emerge in the underlying, requisite behavioral or neural processes. 
Methods: Seventeen matched healthy controls and seventeen patients with schizophrenia participated in an {fMRI} study, which included a social interaction priming procedure wherein they met a friendly stranger who held opposite social values from their own. They answered self-judgement questions about their social values two days before the priming experiment and again during the {fMRI} scan. 
Results: Controls suppress social values when interacting with the stranger whereas patients with schizophrenia augment the opposite values, simultaneously holding two sets of social values. Compared to controls, patients display hyperactivity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and atypical activity in caudate, posterior cingulate and precuneus. 
Discussion: Patients appear to correctly extract social information but apply the information atypically. They display evidence of atypical social flexibility on both performative and neural measures, resulting in confusion between self and other.},

	shorttitle = {Social Values and Determinants of Cultural Fit in Quebec},
	abstract = {Many quantitative cross-cultural research studies assume that cultural groups consist of anyone born and raised in the same country. Applying these criteria to the formation of study samples may produce cohorts that share a country but are heterogeneous in relevant domains of culture. For example, in Canada, Franco- and Anglo-Canadians are generally assumed to represent different linguistic groups but the same cultural group. However, speaking a different first language also can mean exposure to different media, information, and conventions, which are known to shape certain cultural domains, such as social values. Other factors may also produce cultural heterogeneity. For example, ancestral origins and recency of familial migration may influence endorsed social values after exposure to diverse cultures or norms. Mental health status or psychiatric conditions may also influence subscription of social values due to different lifestyle demands. Understanding the nuanced contributions of diverse backgrounds to cultural membership and fit (i.e., the degree to which an individual behaves like other cultural members) is useful when performing quantitative cross-cultural studies to minimize alternative explanations for statistical outcomes. This study used Cultural Consensus Analysis ({CCA}) to assess the cultural fit of social values for 222 Canadians, who had participated in cross-cultural neuropsychological experiments. {CCA} is an anthropological statistical method for evaluating cultural agreement of a sample. Participants were systematically evaluated by linguistic groups (French and English), migratory generation (1st–3rd+), and mental health status (healthy and patient). Group and individual variances were statistically interrogated. Results demonstrated that Franco- and Anglo-Canadians represent different cultural groups cohabitating in Quebec. Social values dividing Franco- and Anglo-Canadians were also identified. Second and third generation Canadians held more heterogeneous social values than Canadians, whose families had migrated earlier. Second generation Canadians with psychiatric disorders showed notably reduced cultural fit with other Canadians, which supports other literature reporting difficulties experienced by second generation migrants. However, third and later generations of Canadians with psychiatric disorders held a greater range of social values compared to healthy Canadians but still were good fits for Canadian culture. This study concluded that linguistic group and migratory generation partially determines cultural group for the social values domain while mental health status does not, contrary to theories proposed by previous literature.},

This study aimed to assess the immediate effects of alcohol-promoting and alcohol-warning video advertising on objective alcohol consumption in heavy-drinking young adults, and to examine underlying processes. Design Between-participants randomized controlled trial with three conditions. Methods Two hundred and four young adults (aged 18–25) who self-reported as heavy drinkers were randomized to view one of three sets of 10 video advertisements that included either (1) alcohol-promoting, (2) alcohol-warning, or (3) non-alcohol advertisements. The primary outcome was the proportion of alcoholic beverages consumed in a sham taste test. Affective responses to advertisements, implicit alcohol approach bias, and alcohol attentional bias were assessed as secondary outcomes and possible mediators. Typical alcohol consumption, Internet use, and television use were measured as covariates. Results There was no main effect of condition on alcohol consumption. Participants exposed to alcohol-promoting advertisements showed increased positive affect and an increased approach/reduced avoidance bias towards alcohol relative to those exposed to non-alcohol advertisements. There was an indirect effect of exposure to alcohol-warning advertisements on reduced alcohol consumption via negative affect experienced in response to these advertisements. Conclusions Restricting alcohol-promoting advertising could remove a potential influence on positive alcohol-related emotions and cognitions among heavy-drinking young adults. Producing alcohol-warning advertising that generates negative emotion may be an effective strategy to reduce alcohol consumption. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Exposure to alcohol advertising has immediate and distal effects on alcohol consumption. There is some evidence that effects may be larger in heavy drinkers. Alcohol-warning advertising has been found to have mixed effects on alcohol-related cognitions. What does this study add? Among heavy-drinking young adults: Alcohol advertising does not appear to have an immediate impact on alcohol consumption. Alcohol advertising generates positive affect and increases alcohol approach bias. Alcohol-warning advertising that generates displeasure reduces alcohol consumption.},

	abstract = {Background: Alcohol marketing has proliferated on social media. When exposed to social media advertisements, users view comments written in response to the ad and user engagement metrics, in addition to the ad itself. Here, the independent effect of different types of comments on alcohol craving was assessed. Methods: In all, n = 722 participants were randomized to view either no comments, pro-drinking comments, anti-drinking comments, warning labels, or industry responsibility messages associated with six alcohol ads. Alcohol cravings, measured using the Desires for Alcohol Questionnaire ({DAQ}), were assessed before and after ad exposure. Smoking urges were also assessed. The significance of main effects was determined using repeated-measures {ANCOVA}. Results: Warning labels significantly decreased scores on the desires and intentions to drink {DAQ} sub-scale (p = .025) and decreased smoking urges (p = .024). Pro-drinking comments significantly increased scores on the control of drinking sub-scale (p = .006). Conclusions: The findings suggest that user-generated comments can influence the desire to drink and smoking urges, beyond the effects of ads themselves. If so, alcohol warning labels may decrease alcohol cravings when used in this way. Additionally, to limit the loss of control over drinking, the ability of social media users to post pro-drinking comments may need to be curtailed.},

	abstract = {One of the essential insights from psychological research is that people’s information processing is often biased. By now, a number of different biases have been identified and empirically demonstrated. Unfortunately, however, these biases have often been examined in separate lines of research, thereby precluding the recognition of shared principles. Here we argue that several—so far mostly unrelated—biases (e.g., bias blind spot, hostile media bias, egocentric/ethnocentric bias, outcome bias) can be traced back to the combination of a fundamental prior belief and humans’ tendency toward belief-consistent information processing. What varies between different biases is essentially the specific belief that guides information processing. More importantly, we propose that different biases even share the same underlying belief and differ only in the specific outcome of information processing that is assessed (i.e., the dependent variable), thus tapping into different manifestations of the same latent information processing. In other words, we propose for discussion a model that suffices to explain several different biases. We thereby suggest a more parsimonious approach compared with current theoretical explanations of these biases. We also generate novel hypotheses that follow directly from the integrative nature of our perspective.},

Education decisions are taken at young ages and involve immediate costs and potential, future benefits. In such settings behavioural barriers (e.g. lack of self-control, limited attention and social norms) likely influence choices and this may motivate the use of low cost ‘nudges’ to gently push behaviour in the desired direction. Our review of nudging interventions shows that while nudging often has positive effects, the greatest effects often arise for individuals affected most by the behavioural barrier targeted by the intervention. Hence understanding underlying behavioural mechanisms is crucial. Negative effects may arise in situations where nudges potentially crowd-out intrinsic motivation, if nudges pressurise individuals, or in situations where the choice architect has an insufficient understanding of behavioural mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Objective Nudges are interventions that alter the way options are presented, enabling individuals to more easily select the best option. Health systems and researchers have tested nudges to shape clinician decision-making with the aim of improving healthcare service delivery. We aimed to systematically study the use and effectiveness of nudges designed to improve clinicians’ decisions in healthcare settings.
Design A systematic review was conducted to collect and consolidate results from studies testing nudges and to determine whether nudges directed at improving clinical decisions in healthcare settings across clinician types were effective. We systematically searched seven databases ({EBSCO} {MegaFILE}, {EconLit}, Embase, {PsycINFO}, {PubMed}, Scopus and Web of Science) and used a snowball sampling technique to identify peer-reviewed published studies available between 1 January 1984 and 22 April 2020. Eligible studies were critically appraised and narratively synthesised. We categorised nudges according to a taxonomy derived from the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. Included studies were appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool.
Results We screened 3608 studies and 39 studies met our criteria. The majority of the studies (90\%) were conducted in the {USA} and 36\% were randomised controlled trials. The most commonly studied nudge intervention (46\%) framed information for clinicians, often through peer comparison feedback. Nudges that guided clinical decisions through default options or by enabling choice were also frequently studied (31\%). Information framing, default and enabling choice nudges showed promise, whereas the effectiveness of other nudge types was mixed. Given the inclusion of non-experimental designs, only a small portion of studies were at minimal risk of bias (33\%) across all Cochrane criteria.
Conclusions Nudges that frame information, change default options or enable choice are frequently studied and show promise in improving clinical decision-making. Future work should examine how nudges compare to non-nudge interventions (eg, policy interventions) in improving healthcare.},

	abstract = {While excess alcohol consumption remains one of the most pressing problems for government and society in many countries, the role of social marketing as a tool for shaping a responsible alcohol consumption culture has grown in significance. This research focuses specifically on the communication aspect of social marketing in the form of social marketing advertising. This study seeks to explore what types of approaches and messages are most prevalent in social marketing advertising campaigns that aim to minimise harm from excess alcohol consumption. This study applies the content analysis method to identify the main themes and messages in a sample of social marketing advertisements. A total of 14 social marketing advertising campaigns, including 29 advertisements, was identified. The analytical framework for this research included both positive and negative consequences of alcohol consumption, and two main social marketing advertising approaches identified in the literature: empowering and patronising. This study found that the patronising approach and a strong focus on the negative consequences of alcohol consumption are prevalent in contemporary social marketing campaigns aimed at minimising harmful drinking behaviours. Social marketing too often takes a patronising approach to encouraging behavioural change. More social marketing efforts should be directed towards identifying how to facilitate and support behaviour change through empowerment by providing consumers with alternative behavioural options.

An important research challenge is to determine how people decide to seek or avoid information. Here we propose a framework of information-seeking that aims to integrate the diverse motives that drive information-seeking and its avoidance. Our framework rests on the idea that information can alter people’s action, affect and cognition in both positive and negative ways. The suggestion is that people assess these influences and integrate them into a calculation of the value of information that leads to information-seeking or avoidance. The theory offers a framework for characterizing and quantifying individual differences in information-seeking, which we hypothesize may also be diagnostic of mental health. We consider biases that can lead to both insufficient and excessive information-seeking. We also discuss how the framework can help government agencies to assess the welfare effects of mandatory information disclosure.},

Analyses indicated a moderate preference for congenial over uncongenial information (d = 0.36).

In support of the importance of defense motivation, the congeniality bias was weaker when participants’ attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors were supported prior to information selection; when participants’ attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors were not relevant to their values or not held with conviction; when the available information was low in quality; when participants’ closed-mindedness was low; and when their confidence in the attitude, belief, or behavior was high.

More precisely, the focus lies on how engaging in online peer chatting on these social platforms alters persuasion knowledge and attitude towards the ad. In order to test this, two between-subjects experiments were conducted in which adolescents chatted with peers on a mock {SNS} that contained a social ad. In Experiment 1, results reveal that a social ad generates a more positive attitude among adolescents when they have engaged in online peer communication, and at the same time, triggers less persuasion knowledge. In Experiment 2, the depth of the relationship between the chatters (tie strength) plays a significant moderating role as peer communication with strong ties yields greater effects, compared to communication with weak ties. These findings reveal important social influence dynamics that may alter the elaboration of persuasive communication, leading to valuable theoretical and practical implications.},

	abstract = {To promote prosocial concerns and call attention to social problems, public service advertising practitioners are increasingly trying to involve laypeople in creating and delivering persuasive campaign messages. An emerging media channel for these efforts is websites that feature user-generated content ({UGC}), particularly the video-sharing website {YouTube}. However, despite this trend, little is known about the extent to which a public service announcement ({PSA}) video will be more effective depending on who produced it. Accordingly, this study empirically tests the degree to which the persuasive impact of a video differs depending on whether the producer is a layperson or an expert. We draw theoretical rationales from several areas to compare the impact of a perceivably similar producer and an expert producer on attitudes towards video, issue importance and behavioural intention. We also analyse how issue involvement moderates these producer effects. Implications for consumer educators, policy makers and marketers are discussed with specific reference to social media.},

In the present study, willingness to sanction was measured with respect to recycling. Results showed that there was an asymmetry between approval and disapproval. That is, while participants expressed approval for the commission of a positive conservation behavior (recycling), they did not express disapproval for the omission of the same behavior. When asked about their willingness to sanction, participants were more willing to reward than punish and more willing to impose subtle versus overt sanctions. Willingness to impose each type of social sanction was correlated with the perceived effectiveness of that sanction. Overall, results showed that students were hesitant to confront environmental transgressors with social sanctions. It is proposed that creating a culture of conservation requires a willingness to confront and that the hesitation to impose social sanctions is due to a lack of metanorms that support the sanctioning.},

We conducted 10 focus group interviews with 47 adolescents (Mage = 16.21; {SD} = 1.22). Our results demonstrated that adolescents frequently encounter images of influencers who hold alcoholic beverages, provide positive reviews for brands, or promote their own beverages. Additionally, building on the Message Interpretation Process model, we examined how individuals affectively (i.e. message desirability) and cognitively (i.e. realism, similarity) evaluate these alcohol images. Our results suggest that adolescents enjoy viewing images of influencers who depicted positive alcohol-related outcomes, highlighted their luxurious lifestyles, and were transparent about their partnership with alcohol brands. Only upon explicitly encouraging them to think aloud about the realism of and similarity to these images; and through discussions with their friends, they became more skeptical and perceived influencers’ images to be inauthentic. Where these critical evaluations took place, the persuasive effects seemed to diminish. Overall, our findings suggest that peer-led discussions and think-aloud procedures may be promising tools for media literacy interventions.},

This study addressed these three goals. A large cross-sectional study among young participants (12–30 years; N = 561) assessed the posting of different types of alcohol posts, the motivations to (not) post these posts, and potential differences in posting between subgroups (i.e., in terms of age, gender, and religion). Participants reported that they most often placed moderate, instead of more extreme, alcohol posts, in particular, when alcohol was present in the post “by chance”. Furthermore, they indicated to post alcohol-related content mostly for entertainment reasons. Finally, we found differences in self-reported posting and motivations to post according to age, gender, and religion. These findings provide relevant implications for future interventions aiming to decrease alcohol posts, for example, by making participants aware of their posting behavior and by targeting specific at risk groups. Future research should explore the effectiveness of such intervention strategies and should investigate whether alcohol posts lead to an underestimation of alcohol-related risks.},

The tape was stopped at the end of each advertisement to allow respondents to answer questions about that advertisement before viewing the next. Perceived likeability of beer advertisements is a function of the positive affective responses evoked by the specific elements featured in the advertisements. Liking of specific elements featured in beer advertisements significantly contributed to the overall likeability of these advertisements and subsequently to advertising effectiveness indicated by purchase intent of product and brand promoted by these advertisements. Advertisements that focus primarily on product qualities or send a message of legal drinking age were rated less favorably and evoked less desire to purchase the product.

With the goal of extending insights into social marketing approaches that promote safer drinking cultures in Australia, we discuss findings from a study that examines alcohol consumers' moderate-drinking intentions. By applying the theory of planned behaviour and emotions theory, we discuss survey results from a sample of alcohol consumers, which demonstrate that positively framed value propositions that evoke happiness and love are more influential in the processing of an alcohol moderation message for alcohol consumers. The key limitations of this study are the cross-sectional nature of the data and the focal-dependent variable being behavioural intentions rather than behaviours. Research insight into the stronger influence of positive emotions on processing an alcohol moderation message establishes an important avenue for future social marketing communications that moves beyond negative, avoidance appeals to promote behaviour change in drinkers. These research findings will benefit professionals involved in developing social change campaigns that promote and reinforce consumers' positive intentions, with messages about the benefits of controlled, moderate drinking.},

	abstract = {Background There is little alcohol research that reports on the thematic contents of contemporary alcohol advertisements in U.S. television. Studies of alcohol ads from 2 decades ago did not identify “Partying” as a social theme. Aim of this study was to describe and classify alcohol advertisements aired in national television in terms of contents, airing times, and channel placements and to identify different marketing strategies of alcohol brands. Methods Content analysis of all ads from the top 20 U.S. beer and spirit brands aired between July 2009 and June 2011. These were 581 unique alcohol ads accounting for 272,828 (78\%) national television airings. Ads were coded according to predefined definitions of 13 content areas. A latent class analysis ({LCA}) was conducted to define content cluster themes and determine alcoholic brands that were more likely to exploit these themes. Results About half of the advertisements (46\%) were aired between 3 am and 8 pm, and the majority were placed either in Entertainment (40\%) and Sports (38\%) channels. Beer ads comprised 64\% of the sample, with significant variation in airing times and channels between types of products and brands. {LCA} revealed 5 content classes that exploited the “Partying,” “Quality,” “Sports,” “Manly,” and “Relax” themes. The partying class, indicative of ad messages surrounding partying, love, and sex, was the dominant theme comprising 42\% of all advertisements. Ads for alcopops, flavored spirits, and liqueur were more likely to belong to the party class, but there were also some beer brands (Corona, Heineken) where more than 67\% of ads exploited this theme. Conclusions This is the first analysis to identify a partying theme to contemporary alcohol advertising. Future analyses can now determine whether exposure to that or other themes predicts alcohol misuse among youth audiences.},

As expected, college students generally expressed higher levels of interest in anti–alcohol abuse media messages when watching fear appeal than those watching humor appeal. However, college binge drinkers who watched the fear appeal reported lower levels of readiness to change their drinking behavior than those who watched the humor appeal. This pattern was the opposite among college nonbinge drinkers, in that college nonbinge drinkers were more likely to say they would change their drinking behaviors when exposed to fear appeal than those who were exposed to humor appeal or those who did not watch any media messages. Conventional fear appeal to scare college binge drinkers seems ineffective and even counterproductive while humor appeal, if well designed, could offer alternative ways to communicate with college binge drinkers.},

	abstract = {Message appeals are a key component of communication campaigns and an important source of campaign influence. However, research on them is heavily fragmented and it is difficult to generalize findings from the many diverse field studies. Based on a large and unique data set using quantitative and qualitative meta-analyses, this research provides measures of the relative impact of each type of appeal, as well as the major differences among them, and identifies the moderating variables that lead to a better understanding of each. This investigation is based on persuasion research, which provides a framework for understanding the unique characteristics of these advertising appeals. It highlights empirical gaps in the academic literature and acts as a conceptual guide for our research hypotheses. Results reveal weaker effect sizes than those previously reported in the literature and show important differences among appeals that lead to a “hierarchy of appeals.” Specifically, emotional appeals, led by sex and humor, appear to be more effective than fear and rational appeals. The study finds new theoretical and empirical generalizations; some results are counterintuitive and differ from findings generated from single appeal studies. Findings are of theoretical and practical importance.},

Starting from the extensive and ever-developing literature on the role of emotions in human information processing and behavior, as studied within general psychology, we discuss how advertising literature has tackled this topic throughout the years. This review reveals that the potential of direct behavioral effects of discrete integral emotions, meaning specific emotions evoked by an advertising message, has remained underexploited. After specifying this research gap, we outline the theoretical rationale behind this behavioral approach and sketch challenges and opportunities to address the potential of discrete emotions and their advertising-relevant behavioral outcomes. We thereby take advantage of the nature of digital media environments and recent methodological advances in this context. We provide guidelines to apply this rationale in advertising research, discuss its strength in comparison with current practice and its potential to extend to incidental emotions, and consider the ethical implications of our proposal.},

Building on this newer wave of research, this article argues that instead of focusing on singular emotional states or collections of emotions evoked by a message, it might prove valuable to explore the flow, or evolution, of emotional experience over the course of exposure to a health message. The article offers a brief introduction to the concept of emotion, followed by a review of the state of the literature on the use of emotion in health messages. The concept of emotional flow is then introduced along with a consideration of how it has been tacitly incorporated into the study of emotional health messages. Finally, the utility of the concept of emotional flow is elaborated by articulating the ways in which it might be harnessed to facilitate the creation of more effective health messages, individually as well as across campaigns.

	abstract = {Objective:

The promotion of drinking behaviors correlates with increased drinking behaviors and intent to drink, especially when peers are the promotion source. Similarly, online displays of peer drinking behaviors have been described as a potential type of peer pressure that might lead to alcohol misuse when the peers to whom individuals feel attached value such behaviors. Social media messages about drinking behaviors on Twitter (a popular social media platform among young people) are common but understudied. In response, and given that drinking alcohol is a widespread activity among young people, we examined Twitter chatter about drinking.

Method:

Tweets containing alcohol- or drinking-related keywords were collected from March 13 to April 11, 2014. We assessed a random sample (n = 5,000) of the most influential Tweets for sentiment, theme, and source.

Results:

Most alcohol-related Tweets reflected a positive sentiment toward alcohol use, with pro-alcohol Tweets outnumbering anti-alcohol Tweets by a factor of more than 10. The most common themes of pro-drinking Tweets included references to frequent or heavy drinking behaviors and wanting/needing/planning to drink alcohol. The most common sources of pro-alcohol Tweets were organic (i.e., noncommercial).

Conclusions:

Our findings highlight the need for online prevention messages about drinking to counter the strong pro-alcohol presence on Twitter. However, to enhance the impact of anti-drinking messages on Twitter, it may be prudent for such Tweets to be sent by individuals who are widely followed on Twitter and during times when heavy drinking is more likely to occur (i.e., weekends, holidays).},

However, little research has tested the utility of this model. We examined (1) whether young adults reported greater drinking and related consequences on months when friendships were more important to them or when they were dating casually, and (2) the extent to which social drinking motives explain these associations on a given month. Methods: Data were drawn from 752 young adults (ages 18–23 at screening) living in the Seattle, {WA} area (56.4\% female). For 24 consecutive months, surveys assessed past month alcohol use and consequences, social drinking motives, friendship importance, and dating/relationship status. Bayesian multilevel models were conducted, adjusting for time-fixed and time-varying covariates. Results: Analyses included 11,591 monthly observations. Between-persons, greater average friendship importance was associated with greater drinking. On months when participants reported greater friendship importance than their own average, they reported greater drinking and alcohol consequences. Those who reported more months of casual dating reported greater drinking and consequences on average. Relative to casual dating months, participants reported less drinking during months they were single or in a relationship and fewer consequences during months in a relationship. Associations were partially accounted for by social motives. Discussion: Findings support the Transitions Catalyst Model. Effective strategies for reducing drinking and associated risks among young adults include brief interventions focused on how social drinking motives and relationships relate to drinking decisions.},

Democracy is at risk when citizens become so polarized that an ‘us versus them’ mentality dominates. Despite a vast multidisciplinary literature, no coherent conceptual framework of the microlevel dynamics that increase or decrease polarization has been presented. In this Review, we provide a conceptual framework to integrate scientific knowledge about cognitive–motivational mechanisms that influence political polarization and the social-communicative contexts in which they are enacted. Ego-justifying and group-justifying motives lead individuals to defend their own pre-existing beliefs and those of their in-group, respectively. However, a distinct class of system-justifying motives contributes to asymmetric forms of polarization. Whereas conservative-rightist ideology is associated with valuing tradition, social order and maintenance of the status quo, liberal-leftist ideology is associated with a push for egalitarian social change. These cognitive–motivational mechanisms interact with social influence processes linked to communication source, message and channel factors, all of which might contribute to increased or decreased polarization. We conclude with a discussion of unanswered questions and ways in which our framework can be extended to the study of culture and institutions.},

Hence, there is a tendency for groups to become more extreme than the initial inclination of its members. We designed an experiment to test whether introducing deliberative norms in like-minded discussions can alleviate such group polarization. Based on their attitudes toward a linguistic minority, participants were divided into a positive and a negative opinion enclave. Within the two enclaves, the participants were randomly assigned to group discussions either with or without deliberative norms. Both face-to-face and online discussions were arranged. We found that free discussion without rules led to group polarization in like-minded groups, whereas polarization could be avoided in groups with deliberative norms.},

However, the method relies on cross-sectional data; its conclusions are open to challenge. Here, a panel study assesses whether the calculated promise of a belief actually predicts future behavior change. A nationally representative sample of 3,204 U.S. youth and young adults were interviewed twice, six months apart. Sixteen beliefs about the benefits and costs of smoking cigarettes are compared with regard to their percentage to gain (calculated from cross-sectional data) and their ability to account for subsequent cigarette use.

	abstract = {Executive functions, or cognitive control, are higher-order cognitive functions needed for adaptive goal-directed behaviours and are significantly impaired in majority of neuropsychiatric disorders. Different models and approaches are proposed for describing how executive functions are functionally organised in the brain. One popular and recently proposed organising principle of executive functions is the distinction between hot (i.e. reward or affective-related) versus cold (i.e. purely cognitive) domains of executive functions. The prefrontal cortex is traditionally linked to executive functions, but on the other hand, anterior and posterior cingulate cortices are hugely involved in executive functions as well. In this review, we first define executive functions, their domains, and the appropriate methods for studying them. Second, we discuss how hot and cold executive functions are linked to different areas of the prefrontal cortex. Next, we discuss the association of hot versus cold executive functions with the cingulate cortex, focusing on the anterior and posterior compartments. Finally, we propose a functional model for hot and cold executive function organisation in the brain with a specific focus on the fronto-cingular network. We also discuss clinical implications of hot versus cold cognition in major neuropsychiatric disorders (depression, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, substance use disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism) and attempt to characterise their profile according to the functional dominance or manifest of hot?cold cognition. Our model proposes that the lateral prefrontal cortex along with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex are more relevant for cold executive functions, while the medial?orbital prefrontal cortex along with the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex are more closely involved in hot executive functions. This functional distinction, however, is not absolute and depends on several factors including task features, context, and the extent to which the measured function relies on cognition and emotion or both.},

Here, we provide an overview of how and why citizens become (and sometimes remain) misinformed about science. Our discussion focuses specifically on misinformation among individual citizens. However, it is impossible to understand individual information processing and acceptance without taking into account social networks, information ecologies, and other macro-level variables that provide important social context. Specifically, we show how being misinformed is a function of a person’s ability and motivation to spot falsehoods, but also of other group-level and societal factors that increase the chances of citizens to be exposed to correct(ive) information. We conclude by discussing a number of research areas—some of which echo themes of the 2017 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Communicating Science Effectively report—that will be particularly important for our future understanding of misinformation, specifically a systems approach to the problem of misinformation, the need for more systematic analyses of science communication in new media environments, and a (re)focusing on traditionally underserved audiences.},

	abstract = {Contemporary commentators describe the current period as “an era of fake news” in which misinformation, generated intentionally or unintentionally, spreads rapidly. Although affecting all areas of life, it poses particular problems in the health arena, where it can delay or prevent effective care, in some cases threatening the lives of individuals. While examples of the rapid spread of misinformation date back to the earliest days of scientific medicine, the internet, by allowing instantaneous communication and powerful amplification has brought about a quantum change. In democracies where ideas compete in the marketplace for attention, accurate scientific information, which may be difficult to comprehend and even dull, is easily crowded out by sensationalized news. In order to uncover the current evidence and better understand the mechanism of misinformation spread, we report a systematic review of the nature and potential drivers of health-related misinformation. We searched {PubMed}, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus and Google databases to identify relevant methodological and empirical articles published between 2012 and 2018. A total of 57 articles were included for full-text analysis. Overall, we observe an increasing trend in published articles on health-related misinformation and the role of social media in its propagation. The most extensively studied topics involving misinformation relate to vaccination, Ebola and Zika Virus, although others, such as nutrition, cancer, fluoridation of water and smoking also featured. Studies adopted theoretical frameworks from psychology and network science, while co-citation analysis revealed potential for greater collaboration across fields. Most studies employed content analysis, social network analysis or experiments, drawing on disparate disciplinary paradigms. Future research should examine susceptibility of different sociodemographic groups to misinformation and understand the role of belief systems on the intention to spread misinformation. Further interdisciplinary research is also warranted to identify effective and tailored interventions to counter the spread of health-related misinformation online.},

We conclude that research on this topic has developed unevenly. Over time, scholars have elaborated on the psychological origins of political misinformation, and this work has cumulated in a productive way. By contrast, although there is an extensive body of research on how to correct misinformation, this literature is less coherent in its recommendations. Finally, a nascent line of research asks whether people's reports of their factual beliefs are genuine or are instead a form of partisan cheerleading.

Using the analogy of a mixing console, the {DSMM} proposes 3 media response states that mediate media effects: cognitive, emotional, and excitative. The assumptions on which the {DSMM} is based together explain (a) why some individuals are more highly susceptible to media effects than others, (b) how and why media influence those individuals, and (c) how media effects can be enhanced or counteracted.},

However, the method relies on cross-sectional data; its conclusions are open to challenge. Here, a panel study assesses whether the calculated promise of a belief actually predicts future behavior change. A nationally representative sample of 3,204 U.S. youth and young adults were interviewed twice, six months apart. Sixteen beliefs about the benefits and costs of smoking cigarettes are compared with regard to their percentage to gain (calculated from cross-sectional data) and their ability to account for subsequent cigarette use.

However, most social behaviors provide only incremental progress toward an ultimate goal. Instead, the drive to engage in any individual social act may derive from its proximal value rather than its ultimate goal. Thus, this proximal value forms the foundation on which the complexities of human sociality are built. We describe two complementary approaches for using proximal social rewards to understand social behaviors and their ultimate goals: (a) decontextualizing social rewards?paring down complex social interactions can help identify which basic building blocks remain valuable even in minimalistic contexts?and (b) recontextualizing social rewards?reintroducing motivational and contextual factors into the study of social experience can help identify how proximal rewards serve their ultimate function.

	abstract = {Background and Aims Youth alcohol consumption is a major global public health concern. Previous reviews have concluded that exposure to alcohol marketing was associated with earlier drinking initiation and higher alcohol consumption among youth. This review examined longitudinal studies published since those earlier reviews. Methods Peer-reviewed papers were identified in medical, scientific and social science databases, supplemented by examination of reference lists. Non-peer-reviewed papers were included if they were published by organizations deemed to be authoritative, were fully referenced and contained primary data not available elsewhere. Papers were restricted to those that included measures of marketing exposure and alcohol consumption for at least 500 underage people. Multiple authors reviewed studies for inclusion and assessed their quality using the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Quality Assessment Tool for Observation Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results Twelve studies (ranging in duration from 9 months to 8 years), following nine unique cohorts not reported on previously involving 35 219 participants from Europe, Asia and North America, met inclusion criteria. All 12 found evidence of a positive association between level of marketing exposure and level of youth alcohol consumption. Some found significant associations between youth exposure to alcohol marketing and initiation of alcohol use (odds ratios ranging from 1.00 to 1.69), and there were clear associations between exposure and subsequent binge or hazardous drinking (odds ratios ranging from 1.38 to 2.15). Mediators included marketing receptivity, brand recognition and alcohol expectancies. Levels of marketing exposure among younger adolescents were similar to those found among older adolescents and young adults. Conclusions Young people who have greater exposure to alcohol marketing appear to be more likely subsequently to initiate alcohol use and engage in binge and hazardous drinking.},

The study used a 2 (civility vs. incivility) × 2 (evidence vs. no evidence) factorial design involving reading dissimilar viewpoints in Facebook comments. The results showed that exposure to uncivil opposing comments, compared to exposure to civil disagreeing comments, led to lower levels of willingness to read more comments and greater levels of negative emotions and attitude polarization. However, the presence or absence of supporting evidence in comments did not have any significant effect on the outcome variables. The findings suggest that it is the civility or incivility of information that influences whether exposure to dissimilar perspectives either mitigates or reinforces individuals’ attitude polarization. This study also suggested willingness to read more comments and negative emotions as two mediating factors between exposure to uncivil/civil disagreeing comments and attitude polarization.},

	abstract = {In public disputes, stakeholders sometimes misrepresent statistics or other types of scientific evidence to support their claims. One of the reasons this is problematic is that citizens often do not have the motivation nor the cognitive skills to accurately judge the meaning of statistics and thus run the risk of being misinformed. This study reports an experiment investigating the conditions under which people become vigilant towards a source’s claim and thus reason more carefully about the supporting evidence. For this, participants were presented with a claim by a vested-interest or a neutral source and with statistical evidence which was cited by the source as being in support of the claim. However, this statistical evidence actually contradicted the source’s claim but was presented as a contingency table, which are typically difficult for people to interpret correctly. When the source was a lobbyist arguing for his company’s product people were better at interpreting the evidence compared to when the same source argued against the product. This was not the case for a different vested-interests source nor for the neutral source. Further, while all sources were rated as less trustworthy when participants realized that the source had misrepresented the evidence, only for the lobbyist source was this seen as a deliberate attempt at deception. Implications for research on epistemic trust, source credibility effects and science communication are discussed.},

Democrats and Republicans both say that the other party's members are hypocritical, selfish, and closed-minded, and they are unwilling to socialize across party lines. This phenomenon of animosity between the parties is known as affective polarization. We trace its origins to the power of partisanship as a social identity, and explain the factors that intensify partisan animus. We also explore the consequences of affective polarization, highlighting how partisan affect influences attitudes and behaviors well outside the political sphere.

Here, we make the case for an experimental design that addresses such issues: an intervention tournament?that is, a study that compares several different interventions against a single control and uses the same standardized outcome measures during assessment and participants drawn from the same population. We begin by highlighting the utility of intervention tournaments as an approach that complements other, more commonly used approaches to addressing societal issues. We then describe various approaches to intervention tournaments, which include crowdsourced, curated, and in-house-developed intervention tournaments, and their unique characteristics. Finally, we discuss practical recommendations and key design insights for conducting such research, given the existing literature. These include considerations of intervention-tournament deployment, characteristics of included interventions, statistical analysis and reporting, study design, longitudinal and underlying psychological mechanism assessment, and theoretical ramifications.},

We theorize that knowledge, attitude extremity, and (in)congruence with political rhetoric explain variation in affective responses. In a large lab study (N = 397), participants watched video clips with left-wing or right-wing rhetoric on prominent issues. We find that people with extreme attitudes experience more arousal in response to political rhetoric and that political rhetoric incongruent with prior attitudes evokes negative affect. Moreover, we show that affective responses lead to opinion change, independent of self-reported emotions. We conclude by setting a research agenda for the alignment between affective and cognitive components of emotions and their consequences.},

Challenges to political beliefs produced increased activity in the default mode network—a set of interconnected structures associated with self-representation and disengagement from the external world.

	abstract = {Although the study of political behaviour has been traditionally restricted to the social sciences, new advances in political neuroscience and computational cognitive science highlight that the biological sciences can offer crucial insights into the roots of ideological thought and action. Echoing the dazzling diversity of human ideologies, this theme issue seeks to reflect the multiplicity of theoretical and methodological approaches to understanding the nature of the political brain. Cutting-edge research along three thematic strands is presented, including (i) computational approaches that zoom in on fine-grained mechanisms underlying political behaviour, (ii) neurocognitive perspectives that harness neuroimaging and psychophysiological techniques to study ideological processes, and (iii) behavioural studies and policy-minded analyses of such understandings across cultures and across ideological domains. Synthesizing these findings together, the issue elucidates core questions regarding the nature of uncertainty in political cognition, the mechanisms of social influence and the cognitive structure of ideological beliefs. This offers key directions for future biologically grounded research as well as a guiding map for citizens, psychologists and policymakers traversing the uneven landscape of modern polarization, misinformation, intolerance and dogmatism.

Two experimental studies explore how citizens evaluate arguments about affirmative action and gun control, finding strong evidence of a prior attitude effect such that attitudinally congruent arguments are evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments. When reading pro and con arguments, participants (Ps) counterargue the contrary arguments and uncritically accept supporting arguments, evidence of a disconfirmation bias. We also find a confirmation bias—the seeking out of confirmatory evidence—when Ps are free to self-select the source of the arguments they read. Both the confirmation and disconfirmation biases lead to attitude polarization—the strengthening of t2 over t1 attitudes—especially among those with the strongest priors and highest levels of political sophistication.

In this context, {COVID} vaccines were made available at an unprecedented time, but a high level of hesitance has been observed that can undermine community immunization. Traditionally, anti-vaccination attitudes are more related to conspiratorial thinking than political bias. In Brazil, a country with an exemplar tradition in large-scale vaccination programs, all {COVID}-related topics have also been discussed under a strong political bias. In this paper, we use a multi-dimensional analysis framework to understand if anti/pro-vaccination stances expressed by Brazilians in social media are influenced by political polarization. The analysis framework incorporates techniques to automatically infer from users their political orientation, topic modeling to discover their concerns, network analysis to characterize their social behavior, and the characterization of information sources and external influence. Our main findings confirm that anti/pro-stances are biased by political polarization, right and left, respectively. While a significant proportion of pro-vaxxers display haste for an immunization program and criticize the government's actions, the anti-vaxxers distrust a vaccine developed in a record time. Anti-vaccination stance is also related to prejudice against China (anti-sinovaxxers), revealing conspiratorial theories related to communism.

Attitude polarization occurred when Ss believed the information came from their in-group. As predicted, this polarization resulted from Ss' adoption of the "extremitized" in-group norm. In Exp {II}, categorization was manipulated by focusing 42 Ss on their group performance or on their individual performance. When Ss were focused on their group membership, group norms were perceived as more extreme, and attitude polarization due to conformity to these extremitized norms occurred. When Ss were focused on their individual performance, no extremitization occurred, and attitudes shifted to a more neutral position on the issue.

	abstract = {Why do voters vote for undemocratic politicians in a democracy? My chief contention is that affective polarization has become a primary factor driving support for undemocratic politicians. Once partisan identification turns into a salient identity in the hierarchy of group affiliations, it has the potential to widen inter-party distances. Such a political environment fosters positive beliefs of their preferred party and negative beliefs of the other party, which promote political cynicism, intolerance and increase partisan loyalty. As a result, crossing party lines becomes costly, even when incumbents violate democratic principles or incumbents’ economic policies do not appeal to supporters’ interests. This tradeoff enables undemocratic politicians to evade electoral sanctions for undemocratic behaviour. I created an extended version of Reiljan’s affective polarization application. The new dataset covers affective polarization scores of 53 countries calculated over 170 national election surveys. I find that increasing affective polarization is highly correlated with democratic backsliding, less accountability, less freedom, fewer rights, and less deliberation in democracies. However, ideological polarization has shown no correlation.},

Most studies use diversity measures that fail to capture contemporary polarization, where the society is divided into two large hostile camps. In this article, we address the gap. Theoretically, we argue that polarization increases animosity between “enemy camps,” making voters more willing to accept anti-democratic measures against the rival group. This tacit approval becomes even more pronounced during election periods, where political controversy reigns and the stakes are higher. Focusing on a specific type of electoral manipulation, we hypothesize that ceteris paribus, political polarization is strongly associated with higher levels of government intimidation of the opposition. We expect this relationship to be stronger in democracies than in autocracies. Empirically, we create our own measure of political polarization based on Esteban and Ray’s widely accepted measure, and test our hypotheses on panel data. In addition to the regression analysis, we offer anecdotal evidence from Turkey, Hungary, and the United States.},

	abstract = {We study the issue of polarization in society through a model of opinion formation. We say an opinion formation process is polarizing if it results in increased divergence of opinions. Empirical studies have shown that homophily, i.e., greater interaction between like-minded individuals, results in polarization. However, we show that {DeGroot}’s well-known model of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can never be polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We generalize {DeGroot}’s model to account for a phenomenon well known in social psychology as biased assimilation: When presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a complex issue, individuals draw undue support for their initial position, thereby arriving at a more extreme opinion. We show that in a simple model of homophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process results in polarization if individuals are sufficiently biased. In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation, is not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation also provides a framework to analyze the polarizing effect of Internet-based recommender systems that show us personalized content.},

We find that the majority of users (60\%) do not follow any political elites. Those who do follow in-group elite accounts at much higher rates than out-group accounts (90 versus 10\%), share information from in-group elites 13 times more frequently than from out-group elites, and often add negative comments to the shared out-group information. Conservatives are twice as likely as liberals to share in-group versus out-group content.

Our results demonstrate that incidental exposure to counter-attitudinal information drives stronger partisans to more actively seek out like-minded political content, which subsequently encourages political information sharing on social media. The results highlight the need to consider both types of political information exposure when modeling citizens' political behavior online.},

Yet even human annotation of social media content does not always capture "stance" as measured by public opinion polls. We demonstrate this by directly comparing an individual's self-reported stance to the stance inferred from their social media data. Leveraging a longitudinal public opinion survey with respondent Twitter handles, we conducted this comparison for 1,129 individuals across four salient targets. We find that recall is high for both "Pro" and "Anti" stance classifications but precision is variable in a number of cases. We identify three factors leading to the disconnect between text and author stance: temporal inconsistencies, differences in constructs, and measurement errors from both survey respondents and annotators. By presenting a framework for assessing the limitations of stance detection models, this work provides important insight into what stance detection truly measures.},

Because individuals’ perceptions of norms guide their personal behavior, influencing these perceptions is one way to create social change. And yet individuals do not form perceptions of typical or desirable behavior in an unbiased manner. Individuals attend to select sources of normative information, and their resulting perceptions rarely match actual rates of behavior in their environment. Thus, changing social norms requires an understanding of how individuals perceive norms in the first place. We describe three sources of information that people use to understand norms—individual behavior, summary information about a group, and institutional signals. Social change interventions have used each source to influence perceived norms and behaviors, including recycling, intimate-partner violence, and peer harassment. We discuss conditions under which influence over perceived norms is likely to be stronger, based on the source of the normative information and individuals’ relationship to the source. Finally, we point to future research and suggest when it is most appropriate to use a norm change strategy in the interest of behavior and social change.},

A potential partial explanation is that certain (e.g., humorous) alcohol ads trigger conversations which can, in turn, increase drinking behaviors. Therefore, we investigated the influence of humor in alcohol ads on conversational occurrence, length, and valence about alcohol and alcohol ads. One hundred and fourteen participants were shown one of three beer ads (humor; positive; no ad), after which participants could voluntarily discuss the ad and alcohol. Next, all participants were requested to discuss the topic and answered a questionnaire assessing conversational valence and ad, brand, and alcohol evaluations. Results showed that humor leads to more conversations about the ad and alcohol, longer conversations about alcohol, and more positive conversations about the ad. This interpersonal communication, and especially conversational valence, was subsequently related to ad, brand, and alcohol evaluations. These findings may explain the effect of alcohol ads on alcohol consumption, and provide important starting points for using humor as a potentially effective behavior change tool.},

	abstract = {Rates of alcohol consumption continue to be a concern, particularly for individuals who are college age. Drinking patterns have changed over time, with the frequency of binge drinking (consuming four/five or more drinks for women/men) remaining high (30\% to 40\%). Young adults in the college age range are developmentally and socially at higher risk for drinking at binge levels. Changes in autonomy, parental control, norms, and attitudes affect binge drinking behaviors. This article reviews those changes, as well as the individual and environmental factors that increase or decrease the risk of participating in binge drinking behaviors. Risk factors include risky drinking events (e.g., 21st birthdays), other substance use, and drinking to cope, while protective factors include religious beliefs, low normative perceptions of drinking, and use of protective behavioral strategies. Additionally, this article discusses the physical, social, emotional, and cognitive consequences of consuming alcohol at binge levels. Alcohol policies and prevention and intervention techniques need to incorporate these factors to reduce experiences of alcohol-related problems. Targeting policy changes and prevention and intervention efforts toward young adults may increase effectiveness and prevent both short- and long-term consequences of binge drinking.

This paper provides an overview of recently published evidence concerning the definition and measurement, prevalence rates, health impact, demographic and psychosocial correlates of, and interventions for, binge drinking.Design: Narrative review.Results: Mostly occurring among young people at weekends, binge drinking increases the risk of both acute (e.g. injuries) and long-term negative consequences (e.g. alcohol disorders). Binge drinkers tend to be extrovert, impulsive and sensation-seeking. Stress, anxiety, traumatic events and depression are also related to binge drinking. Both alcohol-related behaviour of parents and general parenting (e.g. parenting styles, monitoring) are also important. Other major risk factors for binge drinking are frequently spending time with friends who drink, and the drinking norms observed in the wider social environment (e.g. school, community, culture). Emergency departments, birthday parties, fraternities and the workplace serve as settings for interventions; these are increasingly delivered via digital and mobile technology. There is evidence of small-sized effects across approaches (brief interventions, personalised normative feedback, protective behavioural strategies etc.) and populations.Conclusion: A more consistent terminology, investigating multi-level influences and identifying the most effective intervention components are challenges for future research.},

The short‐term effects of binge drinking in college were assessed as well as the extent to which experiences of negative effects in college predicted patterns of alcohol use across the transition from college into postcollege years. As expected, college binge drinkers were comparatively more likely than nonbinge drinkers to experience one or more alcohol‐related problems while in college. In addition, weighted estimates of {DSM}‐{IV}‐defined diagnostic criteria in logistic regression models indicated that the binge drinking patterns exhibited during the college years, for some former college students of both genders, posed significant risk factors for alcohol dependence and abuse 10 years after the initial interview, in conjunction with evidence of academic attrition, early departure from college and less favorable labor market outcomes.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the popularity of procedures for collecting intensive longitudinal data, such as the experience-sampling method, has increased greatly. The data collected using such designs allow researchers to study the dynamics of psychological functioning and how these dynamics differ across individuals. To this end, the data are often modeled with multilevel regression models. An important question that arises when researchers design intensive longitudinal studies is how to determine the number of participants needed to test specific hypotheses regarding the parameters of these models with sufficient power. Power calculations for intensive longitudinal studies are challenging because of the hierarchical data structure in which repeated observations are nested within the individuals and because of the serial dependence that is typically present in these data. We therefore present a user-friendly application and step-by-step tutorial for performing simulation-based power analyses for a set of models that are popular in intensive longitudinal research. Because many studies use the same sampling protocol (i.e., a fixed number of at least approximately equidistant observations) within individuals, we assume that this protocol is fixed and focus on the number of participants. All included models explicitly account for the temporal dependencies in the data by assuming serially correlated errors or including autoregressive effects.},

This manuscript presents the results of a meta-analysis of research on social media use and participation. Overall, the metadata demonstrate a positive relationship between social media use and participation. More than 80\% of coefficients are positive. However, questions remain about whether the relationship is causal and transformative. Only half of the coefficients were statistically significant. Studies using panel data are less likely to report positive and statistically significant coefficients between social media use and participation, compared to cross-sectional surveys.

However, it is currently unclear whether using these platforms actually makes them more politically knowledgeable. While some researchers claim that social media play a critical role in the learning of political information within the modern media environment, others posit that the great potential for learning about politics on social media is rarely fulfilled. The current study tests which of these conflicting theoretical claims is supported by the existing empirical literature. A preregistered meta-analysis of 76 studies (N = 442,136) reveals no evidence of any political learning on social media in observational studies, and statistically significant but substantively small increases in knowledge in experiments. These small-to-nonexistent knowledge gains are observed across social media platforms, types of knowledge, countries, and periods. Our findings suggest that the contribution of social media toward a more politically informed citizenry is minimal.},

Using citations of a series of classic algorithms and the time series of co-authorship as the footprints of their diffusion trajectories, we propose a novel method to analyze the intertwining relationships between broadcasting and virality in the innovation diffusion process. Our findings show that broadcasting and virality have similar diffusion power, but play different roles across diffusion stages. Broadcasting is more powerful in the early stages but may be gradually caught up or even surpassed by virality in the later period. Meanwhile, diffusion speed in virality is significantly faster than broadcasting and members from virality channels tend to adopt the same innovation repetitively.},

	abstract = {In contrast to earlier studies that focus on virality, we examine how individuals share controversial news online by accounting for audience features. The results from surveys of 400 individuals suggest that they are more likely to share highly controversial news (a) on open, asymmetrical social media or (b) with communication partners with a low frequency rather than a high frequency, but are more likely to share moderately controversial news (c) on closed, symmetrical social media. This study implies that interpersonal motives determine the online path of controversial news and that media environments play unique roles in moderating and spreading controversies in society.},

	abstract = {Information sharing within social networks can catalyze widespread attitudinal and behavioral change and the chance to share information with others has been characterized as inherently valuable to people. But what are the sources of value and how might they be leveraged to promote sharing? We test ideas from the value-based virality model that the value of sharing increases when people perceive messages as more relevant to themselves and to people they know, resulting in stronger intentions to share. We extend this work by considering how sharing context—broadcasting to a wide audience or narrowcasting directly to someone—may alter these relationships. Six online studies with adults in the United States (N participants = 3,727; messages = 362; message ratings = 30,954) showed robust evidence that self and social relevance are positively and uniquely related to sharing intentions within- and between-person. Specification curve analysis showed these relationships were consistent across message content ({COVID}-19, voting, general health, climate change), medium (social media post and news articles), and sharing context (broad- and narrowcasting). A preregistered experiment showed that manipulating the self and social relevance of messages through a framing manipulation causally increased sharing intentions. These causal effects were mediated by changes in both self and social relevance, but the relative strength of the causal pathways differed depending on sharing context. These findings extend existing models of information sharing, and highlight self and social relevance as psychological mechanisms that motivate information sharing that can be targeted to promote sharing across contexts.

Additionally, the changing media environment calls for research that expands the scope of what is included as interpersonal communication to include not just conversations but also online forms of communicating information. This study puts forth sharing as such a concept, and examines its prevalence and predictors in the context of tobacco and e-cigarette information. Using a nationally-representative rolling cross-sectional (N = 9,115) and re-contact (N = 2,413) survey of 13–25 year olds, this study found that most young people shared negatively about tobacco (56\% of 1,514 tobacco sharers at Time 1) and mixed information about e-cigarettes (41\% of 968 e-cigarette sharers). Sharing occurrence was predicted by topical relevance and recent exposure to information, while pro-tobacco and pro-e-cigarette sharing (compared to no sharing) was predicted by relevance, and descriptive and injunctive norms. Significant moderation analyses showed that perceived norms undermined the effect of relevance on the valence in which one shared about tobacco and e-cigarettes. These findings provide a foundation upon which to build subsequent research on the impact of sharing, which could help inform future tobacco and e-cigarette control efforts.},

including {HWL} conversations, and socio-demographic variables. Negative binomial generalized estimating equation ({GEE}) models regressed the frequency of {HWL} conversations on study variables. Logistic {GEE} models regressed quit attempts at follow-up surveys on responses from the prior wave, including
frequency of {HWL} conversations and their interaction with ethnicity. Results: Spanish preference Latinos reported the most {HWL} conversations (85\%), followed by English preference Latinos (59\%), and non-Latino Whites (35\%). More frequent {HWL} conversations predicted subsequent quit attempts

Few direct effects of media exposure were found (for online banners, {TV}, and radio in, respectively, one, four, and seven of the 23 models).

Harnessing secondary transmission such as interpersonal communication ({IC}) has helped to reduce tobacco use, but there is a dearth of quasi-experimental research that examines {IC} and the full spectrum of smoking cessation behaviors, particularly in the context of population-level programs. Aims. Using quasi-experimental methods, we examined {IC} in response to a population-level intervention and its impact on the full spectrum of smoking cessation outcomes among low-income smokers. Method. We used propensity score matching; three different propensity score matching procedures were used to estimate and approximate experimental effects. We assessed four cessation outcomes: utilization of a free tobacco quitline ({QL}), making a quit attempt, and being smoke-free for 7 and 30 days at follow-up. We also examined predictors of {IC}. Results. {IC} was significantly related to {QL} utilization (effect sizes ranging from 0.135 to 0.166), making a quit attempt (effect sizes ranging from 0.115 to 0.147), being smoke-free for 7 days (effect sizes ranging from 0.080 to 0.121), and being smoke-free for 30 days at follow-up (effect sizes ranging from 0.058 to 0.082). Program-related and participant characteristics predicted {IC}, such as receiving emotional direct mail materials and living with a fellow smoker. Discussion. {IC} in response to a population-based program affected the cessation process, and {IC} had a marked impact on sustained cessation. Conclusion. Population-based programs should aim to harness psychosocial dynamics such as {IC} to promote sustained cessation among low-income populations.},

	abstract = {Background:
Social interactions are a key mechanism through which health communication campaigns influence behavior. Little research has examined how conversations about pictorial warnings motivate behavior.

Purpose:
We sought to establish whether and how smokers’ conversations explain the effect of pictorial warnings on quit attempts.

Methods:
{US} adult smokers (n=2,149) participated in a controlled trial that randomly assigned them to have their cigarette packs labeled with pictorial or text-only warnings for four weeks. Surveys assessed the number of conversations sparked by pictorial warnings and the theoretical mechanisms cognitive elaboration and social norms at each visit. Analyses used structural equation modeling to test our theorized mediation models.

Results:
The number of conversations about the warnings mediated the relationship between exposure to pictorial warnings and quit attempts (p{\textless}.001). In serial mediation analysis examining possible theoretical mechanisms, the number of conversations was associated with greater cognitive elaboration, which in turn was associated with being more likely to make a quit attempt (p{\textless}.05). Social norms did not explain the influence of conversations on quit attempts.

Conclusions:
Pictorial warnings increased conversations about the warnings, which led to greater cognitive elaboration, which led to greater quit attempts. Our findings suggest designing warnings that increase conversations in order to better inform and motivate smokers. Furthermore, these findings improve our understanding of why conversations matter in health communication.},

This paper considers the impact of the latter on the former, particularly in circumstances where the sharer either does not know or does not suspect that the news they are sharing is fake. This distinction is important because while sharing information and news may be construed as a social good, sharing news that turns out to be fake might negatively impact relationships. How do people react when the news they have shared with the intention of fostering social cohesion turns out to be fake, and as a result damages that cohesion? Based on 12 focus groups, this study examines how social media users react to fake news and how it affects interpersonal relationships between sender and receiver.},

	abstract = {This study investigates factors predicting political information sharing on social media in the election context. Specifically, the current study examines how users’ six motivations for political information sharing and exposure to political disagreement on social media predict their political information sharing behaviors. Analyses of national survey data collected before the 2018 U.S. midterm election suggest that criticism, informing, and socialization motivations, but not expression, awareness, and self-promotion motivations, positively predict political information sharing on social media. Individuals are more likely to share political information when they are exposed to information that is disagreeable. This relationship is stronger among individuals with higher epistemic political efficacy and lower political knowledge.},

Design/methodology/approach An online survey was conducted in the {US} and Korea. Findings The findings demonstrated that both American and Korean consumers share {MGC} for several reasons: liking/helping the brand, self-presentation/social interaction, economic rewards, and entertainment. In addition to these four motivations, Korean consumers also share {MGC} with others to offer information that may be of use to them. These different types of motivations were associated with the frequency of sharing {MGC} directly from Facebook brand pages, of re-sharing what Facebook friends shared first, of adding comments when sharing, and of sharing different types of {MGC} differently. We found similarities and differences in the patterns of these relationships between the {US} and Korea. Originality/value Although many studies on electronic word of mouth ({eWOM}) have examined consumers’ motivations for providing consumer-generated content, research on consumer motivations to forward marketer-generated content is scarce. Additionally, earlier work examined the influences of motivation on sharing in general and on a certain type of {MGC}. Our findings that focused on various types of motivations to share {MGC}, and their influences on various types of {MGC} and specific types of sharing activities can provide a more complete picture than what was previously available in the {eWOM} literature. Further, by comparing American consumers’ motivations to share {MGC} on {SNSs} and their influences on sharing activities with those of Korean consumers, this study contributes to building a body of cross-cultural studies on consumer sharing of {MGC}.},

By considering different functional neuroimaging applications, we illustrate how scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library, can be used to perform some key analysis steps.

It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own {NumPy}-like interfaces and array objects.

These two processes overlap in terms of the component processes involved, and share overlapping functional organizations within the human brain, in particular within the medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}). Several functional models have been proposed to explain these two processes, but none has directly explored the extent to which they are distinctly represented within different parts of the brain. This study used multivoxel pattern classification to quantify the separability of self- and other-related thought in the {MPFC} and expanded this question to the entire brain. Using a large-scale mega-analytic dataset, spanning three separate studies (n = 142), we find that self- and other-related thought can be reliably distinguished above chance within the {MPFC}, posterior cingulate cortex and temporal lobes. We highlight subcomponents of the ventral {MPFC} that are particularly important in representing self-related thought, and subcomponents of the orbitofrontal cortex robustly involved in representing other-related thought. Our findings indicate that representations of self- and other-related thought in the human brain are described best by a distributed pattern rather than stark localization or a purely ventral to dorsal linear gradient in the {MPFC}.},

Ratings were more favorable for green ads than for control ads, but the functional {MRI} data suggested an opposite pattern—participants showed greater activation in regions associated with personal value and reward (ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum) in response to control ads relative to green ads. In addition, participants showed greater activity in these regions to the extent that they reported liking control ads, but there was no such trend for green ads. In line with a neuroeconomic account, we suggest that activity in these regions may be indexing a value signal computed during message exposure that may influence downstream purchase decisions, in contrast to self-reported evaluations that may reflect social desirability concerns absent at the point of purchase.},

Here, we examine how thinking about sharing affects neural encoding of information, and whether this effect is moderated by the person’s real-life social network position. In an functional magnetic resonance imaging study, participants rated abstracts of news articles on how much they wanted to read for themselves (read) or—as information gatekeepers—to share with a specific other (narrowcast) or to post on their social media feed (broadcast). In all conditions, consistent spatial blood oxygen level-dependent patterns associated with news articles were observed across participants in brain regions involved in perceptual and language processing as well as higher-order processes. However, when thinking about sharing, encoding consistency decreased in higher-order processing areas (e.g., default mode network), suggesting that the gatekeeper role involves more individualized processing in the brain, that is, person- and context-specific. Moreover, participants whose social networks had high ego-betweenness centrality (i.e., more likely to be information gatekeeper in real life) showed more individualized encoding when thinking about broadcasting. This study reveals how gatekeeping shapes our brain’s processing of incoming information.},

In this exploratory study, we investigate how the brain makes purchase decisions when it encounters different types of visual presentation strategies. Specifically, we use event-related {fMRI} to study brain activation preceding purchase decisions under three visual presentation strategies: (1) static picture, (2) image zooming, and (3) rotation video. Twenty-four (24) participants made 60 apparel purchase decisions. Utilizing machine learning, we study whether and how various neural circuits are engaged in purchase decision-making in regard to different types of visual sensory information. The functional neuroimaging results suggest high accuracy (highest: 95\%, Rotation condition) in predicting purchase decisions using brain activity in the product evaluation process. Furthermore, cross-category validation reveals the activation patterns under the Rotation condition most successfully predict choices across the other two presentation conditions: this suggests a potential universal brain activity pattern in these apparel purchase decisions. Finally, we found some brain regions (such as the cerebellum) that are less likely to be associated with purchase decisions but are considered influential in predicting online apparel purchase decisions in the context of watching a rotation product video. The cerebellar activation may suggest association with spatial cognition and virtual navigation in addition to motor control. This study contributes to the research field of {NeuroIS} and online shopper study. The results provide empirical evidence to support the refined S-O-R theoretical model Jacoby (2002) and heuristic information process and inform the practical implications of sensory-engaging presentations in helping consumers to make online purchase decisions.},

	abstract = {Overweight and obesity have become international public health problems, so there is an urgent need to implement effective interventions that prevent these concerning health issues. Designing personalized (tailored) dietary communications has become one of the most effective tools in reducing unhealthy eating behavior, when compared with one-size-fits-all messages (untailored). However, more research is required to gain a complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which tailored nutritional messages elicit reductions in unhealthy dietary behavior. To the best of our knowledge, our study may be the first to use neuroimaging, namely functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), aiming to evaluate the neural basis of tailored and untailored nutritional messages and assess how these neural responses predict unhealthy food intake reduction after a month receiving tailored nutritional messages. To that goal, 30 participants were scanned while reading tailored and untailored nutritional messages. Subsequently, for a month, they received tailored interventions encouraging healthy food intake. The neural findings reveal that when compared to untailored communications, tailored messages elicit brain networks associated with self-relevance, such as the precuneus, the middle temporal gyrus, the hippocampus, the inferior orbitofrontal cortex ({OBC}), the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ({dMPFC}), and the angular gyrus. Interestingly, among these self-related brain areas, the {dMPFC}, {OFC}, angular gyrus, and hippocampus forecast reductions in unhealthy food intake after a one-month tailored intervention for the cessation of unhealthy eating. These results may offer implications for clinicians, practitioners, and/or policymakers who should implement substantial efforts in creating individualized campaigns focused on their target's perceived needs, goals, and drivers in relation to eating healthy to reduce overweight issues. This research therefore constitutes a step forward in showing a direct association between the neural responses to tailored nutritional messages and changes in real-life healthy eating behavior.},

The intense popularity of social media is often attributed to a psychological need for social rewards (likes), portraying the online world as a Skinner Box for the modern human. Yet despite such portrayals, empirical evidence for social media engagement as reward-based behavior remains scant. Here, we apply a computational approach to directly test whether reward learning mechanisms contribute to social media behavior. We analyze over one million posts from over 4000 individuals on multiple social media platforms, using computational models based on reinforcement learning theory. Our results consistently show that human behavior on social media conforms qualitatively and quantitatively to the principles of reward learning. Specifically, social media users spaced their posts to maximize the average rate of accrued social rewards, in a manner subject to both the effort cost of posting and the opportunity cost of inaction. Results further reveal meaningful individual difference profiles in social reward learning on social media. Finally, an online experiment (n = 176), mimicking key aspects of social media, verifies that social rewards causally influence behavior as posited by our computational account. Together, these findings support a reward learning account of social media engagement and offer new insights into this emergent mode of modern human behavior.},

This common design agenda is supported through analysis of link sharing, yet little attention has been paid to how users discuss these links. Therefore, the common design agenda may not mitigate polarization. We study the emergent discourse in 10 Finnish migration-related Facebook groups and examine how the same links are shared and discussed across anti- and pro-migration camps. Qualitative analysis of the posts and comments revealed that shared media links do not bridge polarized groups with regard to worldviews and opinions. We then demonstrate alternative design opportunities to resolve this issue and begin to develop a new design agenda to mitigate polarization.},

	abstract = {In researches that examine neuroplasticity, many studies that are performed directly on isolated neurons in the pyramidal cells of {CA}1 area ({CA}1) and slices of the hippocampus indicate that changes occur at the molecular and cellular levels during long-term synaptic potentiation ({LTP}), and these changes are dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartate ({NMDA}) acid receptors and/or purinergic receptors. Electrophysiological studies and the chemical induction of {LTP} of synaptic neurotransmissions provide key evidence that {LTP} is dependent on the volume of Ca2+ influx through postsynaptic {NMDA} receptors, in addition to the subsequent activation and autophosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase {II} ({CaMKII}) and the increase in the density of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ({AMPA}) receptors on postsynaptic neuronal membranes. The primary peculiarity of {LTP} in the central nervous system ({CNS}) excitatory synapses is the synthesis of additional {AMPA} receptors in the postsynaptic elements. Furthermore, the proteolysis of the extracellular matrix ({ECM}) has an important role in the synaptic neuroplasticity of the {CNS}. Proteases from the serine family and metalloproteinases of the extracellular matrix are localized within the synapses and are released into the extracellular space in proportion to the degree of neuronal excitation. These enzymes cause changes in the morphology, shape and size, as well as the overall number of synapses and synthesize new synaptic connections. The proteinases also change the function of receptors, and consequently, the secretions of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic elements are strengthened or weakened.},

Across three studies and using different health conditions, we show that fixed-mindset consumers' beliefs about immutability lead them to donate more to less (vs. more) controllable causes. The results show that this effect is driven by their tendency to blame people with more controllable health conditions. Conversely, controllability does not influence consumers with growth mindsets, who believe in the changeability of health conditions. Moreover, we examine benefit framing as a potential persuasive factor encouraging donations of consumers with growth mindsets. Specifically, we find that in less controllable cases, consumers with growth mindsets are more persuaded to donate by other-benefit appeals (focusing on how donating enhances others' lives and makes others feel better); in more controllable conditions, they are more persuaded by self-benefit appeals (focusing on how donating enhances their own lives and makes them feel better). The perceived efficacy of donation drives this effect. Meanwhile, consumers with fixed mindsets are more willing to donate to less (vs. more) controllable causes regardless of benefit frames used in the charity ad. This research offers managerial implications for advertisers and marketers.},

Particularly, this effect holds for individuals with a growth mindset. These consumers believe in the changeability of the world and, therefore, are more adept at accepting negative emotions in positive pursuits entailed in meaningful, but not happy, stories.},

Resistance to persuasion has been studied in many different disciplines, including communication science, psychology, and marketing. The present paper reviews and connects these diverse literatures, and provides an organizing framework for understanding and studying resistance. Four clusters of resistance strategies are defined (avoidance, contesting, biased processing, and empowerment), and these clusters are related to different motivations for resisting persuasion (threat to freedom, reluctance to change, and concerns of deception). We propose that, while avoidance strategies may be triggered by any of these motivations, contesting strategies are linked primarily to concerns of deception, while empowerment and biased processing strategies are most common when people are reluctant to change.},

	abstract = {Many psychological theories suggest a link between self-regulation and identity, but, until now, a mechanistic account that suggests ways to improve self-regulation has not been put forth. The identity-value model ({IVM}) connects the idea from social psychology that aspects of identity such as core values and group affiliations hold positive subjective value to the process-focused account from decision making and behavioral economics that self-regulation is driven by a dynamic value integration across a range of choice attributes. Together, these ideas imply that goal-directed behaviors that are identity relevant are more likely to be enacted because they have greater subjective value than identity-irrelevant behaviors. A central hypothesis, therefore, is that interventions that increase the degree to which a target behavior is perceived as self-relevant will improve self-regulation. In addition, identity-based changes in self-regulation are expected to be mediated by changes in subjective value and its underlying neural systems. In this article we define the key constructs relevant to the {IVM}, explicate the model and delineate its boundary conditions, and describe how it fits with related theories. We also review disparate results in the research literature that might share identity-related value as a common underlying mechanism of action. We close by discussing questions about the model, the answers to which could advance the study of self-regulation.},

	abstract = {Background: Effective communication during a health crisis can ease public concerns and promote the adoption of important risk-mitigating behaviors. Public health agencies and leaders have served as the primary communicators of information related to {COVID}-19, and a key part of their public outreach has taken place on social media platforms.
Objective: This study examined the content and engagement of {COVID}-19 tweets authored by Canadian public health agencies and decision makers. We propose ways for public health accounts to adjust their tweeting practices during public health crises to improve risk communication and maximize engagement.
Methods: We retrieved data from tweets by Canadian public health agencies and decision makers from January 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020. The Twitter accounts were categorized as belonging to either a public health agency, regional or local health department, provincial health authority, medical health officer, or minister of health. We analyzed trends in {COVID}-19 tweet engagement and conducted a content analysis on a stratified random sample of 485 tweets to examine the message functions and risk communication strategies used by each account type.
Results: We analyzed 32,737 tweets authored by 118 Canadian public health Twitter accounts, of which 6982 tweets were related to {COVID}-19. Medical health officers authored the largest percentage of {COVID}-19–related tweets (n=1337, 35\%) relative to their total number of tweets and averaged the highest number of retweets per {COVID}-19 tweet (112 retweets per tweet). Public health agencies had the highest frequency of daily tweets about {COVID}-19 throughout the study period. Compared to tweets containing media and user mentions, hashtags and {URLs} were used in tweets more frequently by all account types, appearing in 69\% (n=4798 tweets) and 68\% (n=4781 tweets) of {COVID}-19–related tweets, respectively. Tweets containing hashtags also received the highest average retweets (47 retweets per tweet). Our content analysis revealed that of the three tweet message functions analyzed (information, action, community), tweets providing information were the most commonly used across most account types, constituting 39\% (n=181) of all tweets; however, tweets promoting actions from users received higher than average retweets (55 retweets per tweet). When examining tweets that received one or more retweet (n=359), the difference between mean retweets across the message functions was statistically significant (P\&lt;.001). The risk communication strategies that we examined were not widely used by any account type, appearing in only 262 out of 485 tweets. However, when these strategies were used, these tweets received more retweets compared to tweets that did not use any risk communication strategies (P\&lt;.001) (61 retweets versus 13 retweets on average).
Conclusions: Public health agencies and decision makers should examine what messaging best meets the needs of their Twitter audiences to maximize sharing of their communications. Public health accounts that do not currently employ risk communication strategies in their tweets may be missing an important opportunity to engage with users about the mitigation of health risks related to {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {We describe the effect of social media advertising content on customer engagement using data from Facebook. We content-code 106,316 Facebook messages across 782 companies, using a combination of Amazon Mechanical Turk and natural language processing algorithms. We use this data set to study the association of various kinds of social media marketing content with user engagement—defined as Likes, comments, shares, and click-throughs—with the messages. We find that inclusion of widely used content related to brand personality—like humor and emotion—is associated with higher levels of consumer engagement (Likes, comments, shares) with a message. We find that directly informative content—like mentions of price and deals—is associated with lower levels of engagement when included in messages in isolation, but higher engagement levels when provided in combination with brand personality–related attributes. Also, certain directly informative content, such as deals and promotions, drive consumers’ path to conversion (click-throughs). These results persist after incorporating corrections for the nonrandom targeting of Facebook’s {EdgeRank} (News Feed) algorithm and so reflect more closely user reaction to content than Facebook’s behavioral targeting. Our results suggest that there are benefits to content engineering that combines informative characteristics that help in obtaining immediate leads (via improved click-throughs) with brand personality–related content that helps in maintaining future reach and branding on the social media site (via improved engagement). These results inform content design strategies. Separately, the methodology we apply to content-code text is useful for future studies utilizing unstructured data such as advertising content or product reviews.

	abstract = {This study examined how message features and social endorsements affect the longevity of audience news sharing by analyzing behavioral data of social retransmission of New York Times health news articles, and associated article content and context data. The results showed that information utility-related message features increased the duration for which articles prompted email-based sharing, whereas emotional positivity and controversiality increased the longevity of social media-based sharing. Expressed emotional evocativeness and the absence of death-related words lengthened the duration for which articles prompted both email- and social media-based sharing. News retransmission, via either email or social media, was more likely to persist when the articles stayed on the “most-emailed” list for a longer time, showing social endorsement-driven cumulative advantage effects. The results further revealed synergistic interaction effects between social endorsements and message features. While social endorsements produced strong cumulative-advantage effects on the longevity of news sharing, articles with certain message features that are diagnostic of their inherent share-worthiness generated even stronger effects than those articles that appeared on the “most-emailed” list for the same amount of time but lacked such features. These features were expressed emotional evocativeness (email-based sharing), the absence of death-related words, and exemplification (social media-based sharing).},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.6670},
	abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus ({HPV}) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. There are several vaccines that protect against strains of {HPV} most associated with cervical and other cancers. Thus, {HPV} vaccination has become an important component of adolescent preventive health care. As media evolves, more information about {HPV} vaccination is shifting to social media platforms such as Twitter. Health information consumed on social media may be especially influential for segments of society such as younger populations, as well as ethnic and racial minorities. Objective: The objectives of our study were to quantify {HPV} vaccine communication on Twitter, and to develop a novel methodology to improve the collection and analysis of Twitter data. Methods: We collected Twitter data using 10 keywords related to {HPV} vaccination from August 1, 2014 to July 31, 2015. Prospective data collection used the Twitter Search {API} and retrospective data collection used Twitter Firehose. Using a codebook to characterize tweet sentiment and content, we coded a subsample of tweets by hand to develop classification models to code the entire sample using machine learning procedures. We also documented the words in the 140-character tweet text most associated with each keyword. We used chi-square tests, analysis of variance, and nonparametric equality of medians to test for significant differences in tweet characteristic by sentiment. Results: A total of 193,379 English-language tweets were collected, classified, and analyzed. Associated words varied with each keyword, with more positive and preventive words associated with “{HPV} vaccine” and more negative words associated with name-brand vaccines. Positive sentiment was the largest type of sentiment in the sample, with 75,393 positive tweets (38.99\% of the sample), followed by negative sentiment with 48,940 tweets (25.31\% of the sample). Positive and neutral tweets constituted the largest percentage of tweets mentioning prevention or protection (20,425/75,393, 27.09\% and 6477/25,110, 25.79\%, respectively), compared with only 11.5\% of negative tweets (5647/48,940; P{\textless}.001). Nearly one-half (22,726/48,940, 46.44\%) of negative tweets mentioned side effects, compared with only 17.14\% (12,921/75,393) of positive tweets and 15.08\% of neutral tweets (3787/25,110; P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: Examining social media to detect health trends, as well as to communicate important health information, is a growing area of research in public health. Understanding the content and implications of conversations that form around {HPV} vaccination on social media can aid health organizations and health-focused Twitter users in creating a meaningful exchange of ideas and in having a significant impact on vaccine uptake. This area of research is inherently interdisciplinary, and this study supports this movement by applying public health, health communication, and data science approaches to extend methodologies across fields.},

	abstract = {Background: Social media public health campaigns have the advantage of tailored messaging at low cost and large reach, but little is known about what would determine their feasibility as tools for inducing attitude and behavior change. Objective: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of designing, implementing, and evaluating a social media–enabled intervention for skin cancer prevention. Methods: A quasi-experimental feasibility study used social media (Twitter) to disseminate different message “frames” related to care in the sun and cancer prevention. Phase 1 utilized the Northern Ireland cancer charity’s Twitter platform (May 1 to July 14, 2015). Following a 2-week “washout” period, Phase 2 commenced (August 1 to September 30, 2015) using a bespoke Twitter platform. Phase 2 also included a Thunderclap, whereby users allowed their social media accounts to automatically post a bespoke message on their behalf. Message frames were categorized into 5 broad categories: humor, shock or disgust, informative, personal stories, and opportunistic. Seed users with a notable following were contacted to be “influencers” in retweeting campaign content. A pre- and postintervention Web-based survey recorded skin cancer prevention knowledge and attitudes in Northern Ireland (population 1.8 million). Results: There were a total of 417,678 tweet impressions, 11,213 engagements, and 1211 retweets related to our campaign. Shocking messages generated the greatest impressions (shock, n=2369; informative, n=2258; humorous, n=1458; story, n=1680), whereas humorous messages generated greater engagement (humorous, n=148; shock, n=147; story, n=117; informative, n=100) and greater engagement rates compared with story tweets. Informative messages, resulted in the greatest number of shares (informative, n=17; humorous, n=10; shock, n=9; story, n=7). The study findings included improved knowledge of skin cancer severity in a pre- and postintervention Web-based survey, with greater awareness that skin cancer is the most common form of cancer (preintervention: 28.4\% [95/335] vs postintervention: 39.3\% [168/428] answered “True”) and that melanoma is most serious (49.1\% [165/336] vs 55.5\% [238/429]). The results also show improved attitudes toward ultraviolet ({UV}) exposure and skin cancer with a reduction in agreement that respondents “like to tan” (60.5\% [202/334] vs 55.6\% [238/428]). Conclusions: Social media–disseminated public health messages reached more than 23\% of the Northern Ireland population. A Web-based survey suggested that the campaign might have contributed to improved knowledge and attitudes toward skin cancer among the target population. Findings suggested that shocking and humorous messages generated greatest impressions and engagement, but information-based messages were likely to be shared most. The extent of behavioral change as a result of the campaign remains to be explored, however, the change of attitudes and knowledge is promising. Social media is an inexpensive, effective method for delivering public health messages. However, existing and traditional process evaluation methods may not be suitable for social media.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we examine which content characteristics lead to increased sharing of political information on social media, and which role political ideology has in user sharing behavior. More specifically, we investigate the impact of emotions and authority on sharing, as well as the moderating role of political extremity of social media users. We analyzed 10,141 political tweets, sent by 527 influencers between July 2019 and June 2020. The results reveal that content in which emotions are more prevalent than argument quality is more likely to be shared than content in which argument quality is prevalent. Perhaps surprisingly, we also show that content in which positive emotions are more prevalent than negative emotions is more likely to be shared than content in which negative emotions are prevalent. Moreover, authority (i.e., a dominant language style and a high number of followers) can lead to increased shares. Finally, we find that content in which positive emotions are more prevalent than negative emotions is less effective in increasing shares when users are located at the ideological extreme compared to the ideological center. On the one hand, we provide insights into how influencers in social media networks can be utilized for political campaigning. On the other hand, we provide insights into what makes users engage with political content from influencers that might contribute to political polarization on social media.},

Across subjects, there were considerable differences in the distribution of cigarettes smoked across the activity and internal states categories. Within subjects, all subjects showed variation in measures of smoking topography (number of puffs/cigarette, mean puff duration, total puff time/cigarette) as a function of situational variables. It did not appear that pharmacological factors could fully account for the substantial situational differences found.

	abstract = {Background We assessed whether the Australian plain packs with larger graphic health warnings ({GHWs}) achieved three specific objectives of reducing the appeal of tobacco, increasing health warning effectiveness and reducing the ability of packaging to mislead about smoking harms.
Methods We compared responses from continuous cross-sectional telephone surveys of n=2176 cigarette smokers during pre-plain packaging (April–September 2012, pre-{PP}) with n=759 surveyed in the transition period (October–November 2012) and n=4240 during the first year of implementation (December 2012–November 2013, {PP} year 1), using multivariate logistic regression analyses.
Results From pre-{PP} to {PP} year 1, more smokers disliked their pack (p{\textless}0.001), perceived lower pack appeal (p{\textless}0.001), lower cigarette quality (p{\textless}0.001), lower satisfaction (p{\textless}0.001) and lower value (p{\textless}0.001) and disagreed brands differed in prestige (p=0.003). There was no change in perceived differences in taste of different brands. More smokers noticed {GHWs} (p{\textless}0.001), attributed much motivation to quit to {GHWs} (p{\textless}0.001), avoided specific {GHWs} when purchasing (p{\textless}0.001), and covered packs (p{\textless}0.001), with no change in perceived exaggeration of harms. {PP} year 1 saw an increased proportion believing that brands do not differ in harmfulness (p=0.004), but no change in the belief that variants do not differ in strength or the perceived harmfulness of cigarettes compared with a year ago. Interactions signified greater change for four outcomes assessing aspects of appeal among young adults and two appeal outcomes among mid-aged adults.
Conclusions The specific objectives of plain packaging were achieved and generally sustained among adult smokers up to 12 months after implementation.},

	abstract = {In multivariate pattern analysis of neuroimaging data, 'second-level' inference is often performed by entering classification accuracies into a \$t\$-test vs chance level across subjects. We argue that while the random-effects analysis implemented by the \$t\$-test does provide population inference if applied to activation differences, it fails to do so in the case of classification accuracy or other 'information-like' measures, because the true value of such measures can never be below chance level. This constraint changes the meaning of the population-level null hypothesis being tested, which becomes equivalent to the global null hypothesis that there is no effect in any subject in the population. Consequently, rejecting it only allows to infer that there are some subjects in which there is an information effect, but not that it generalizes, rendering it effectively equivalent to fixed-effects analysis. This statement is supported by theoretical arguments as well as simulations. We review possible alternative approaches to population inference for information-based imaging, converging on the idea that it should not target the mean, but the prevalence of the effect in the population. One method to do so, 'permutation-based information prevalence inference using the minimum statistic', is described in detail and applied to empirical data.},

Social media, on the other hand, frequently employs exhibitions, such as lists of status updates and sets of photos, alongside situational activities, such as chatting. A key difference in exhibitions is the virtual “curator” that manages and redistributes this digital content. This article introduces the exhibitional approach and the curator and suggests ways in which this approach can extend present work concerning online presentation of self. It introduces a theory of “lowest common denominator” culture employing the exhibitional approach.},

Studies were included if they focused on patients/consumers, involved an {SNS} intervention, had an outcome related to health behavior change, and were prospective. Studies were screened by independent investigators, and assessed using Cochrane's ‘risk of bias’ tool. Randomized controlled trials were pooled in a meta-analysis.Results The database search retrieved 4656 citations; 12 studies (7411 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Facebook was the most utilized {SNS}, followed by health-specific {SNSs}, and Twitter. Eight randomized controlled trials were combined in a meta-analysis. A positive effect of {SNS} interventions on health behavior outcomes was found (Hedges’ g 0.24; 95\% {CI} 0.04 to 0.43). There was considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 84.0\%; T2 = 0.058) and no evidence of publication bias.Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of {SNS} interventions in changing health-related behaviors. Most studies evaluated multi-component interventions, posing problems in isolating the specific effect of the {SNS}. Health behavior change theories were seldom mentioned in the included articles, but two particularly innovative studies used ‘network alteration’, showing a positive effect. Overall, {SNS} interventions appeared to be effective in promoting changes in health-related behaviors, and further research regarding the application of these promising tools is warranted.Conclusions Our study showed a positive effect of {SNS} interventions on health behavior-related outcomes, but there was considerable heterogeneity.Protocol registration The protocol for this systematic review is registered at http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/{PROSPERO} with the number {CRD}42013004140.},

The motives have implications for information processing and for attitude change in public and private contexts. Motives in persuasion also have been investigated in research on attitude functions and cognitive dissonance theory. In addition, the chapter reviews the relatively unique aspects of each literature: In persuasion, it considers the cognitive and affective mechanisms underlying attitude change, especially dual-mode processing models, recipients’ affective reactions, and biased processing. In social influence, the chapter considers how attitudes are embedded in social relations, including social identity theory and majority/minority group influence.},

There is worldwide concern over false news and the possibility that it can influence political, economic, and social well-being. To understand how false news spreads, Vosoughi et al. used a data set of rumor cascades on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. About 126,000 rumors were spread by ∼3 million people. False news reached more people than the truth; the top 1\% of false news cascades diffused to between 1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000 people. Falsehood also diffused faster than the truth. The degree of novelty and the emotional reactions of recipients may be responsible for the differences observed.
Science, this issue p. 1146
We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise {\textasciitilde}126,000 stories tweeted by {\textasciitilde}3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.
A large-scale analysis of tweets reveals that false rumors spread further and faster than the truth.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {AIMS}: Young adults show the highest rates of escalating drinking, yet the neural risk mechanisms remain unclear. Heavy drinkers show variant functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) blood oxygen level-dependent ({BOLD}) response to alcohol cues, which may presage increasing drinking. In this longitudinal study, we ascertained whether {BOLD} response to alcohol pictures predicted subsequent heavy drinking among college students.
{METHODS}: Participants were 43 18-21-year-olds in the United States who underwent {BOLD} scanning and completed monthly substance use surveys over the following year. Participants were categorized according to baseline and follow-up drinking into 13 continuously moderate drinkers, 16 continuously heavy drinkers and 14 transitioners who drank moderately at baseline but heavily by follow-up. During {fMRI} scanning at baseline, participants viewed alcohol and matched non-alcohol beverage images.
{RESULTS}: We observed group differences in alcohol cue-elicited {BOLD} response in bilateral caudate, orbitofrontal cortex, medial frontal cortex/anterior cingulate and left insula (clusters {\textgreater} 2619 ml, voxelwise F(2,40)  {\textgreater} 3.23, P {\textless} 0.05, whole-brain corrected P {\textless} 0.05), where transitioners hyperactivated compared with moderate and heavy drinkers (all Tukey P {\textless} 0.05). Exploratory factor analysis revealed a single brain network differentiating those who subsequently increased drinking. Exploratory regressions showed that, compared with other risk factors (e.g., alcoholism family history, impulsivity), {BOLD} response best predicted escalating drinking amount and alcohol-related problems.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Neural response to pictures of alcohol is substantially enhanced among United States college students who subsequently escalate drinking. Greater cue-reactivity is associated with larger increases in drinking and alcohol-related problems, regardless of other baseline factors. Thus, neural cue-reactivity could uniquely facilitate identifying individuals at greatest risk for future problematic drinking.},

This is comparatively easy to assess in two-party systems, but capturing the pattern of affect towards multiple parties is more complex in multiparty systems. This article first discusses these challenges and then presents different ways of measuring individual-level affective polarization using like-dislike scores, a widespread measure of party sympathy. Using data for 51 countries and 166 elections from five modules of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, I then show that affective polarization adds to existing concepts as a way of understanding political participation and democratic orientations. Studying affective polarization outside the {US} could therefore have important consequences for our understanding of citizen perceptions of politics as well as citizen behaviour, but we need the appropriate measures to do so.},

	abstract = {Objective: The present study examines the relationships among reasons for drinking, alcohol consumption, and alcohol-related consequences in two college-aged samples. Personal motivators such as mood enhancement and coping (tension reduction) have consistently been shown to predict problematic alcohol use, but because of the salient nature of social drinking in college, we hypothesized that social reasons for drinking would be most frequently endorsed and, in turn, predict negative consequences. Method: T w o distinct samples—119 coed adjudicated students sanctioned by the university for violating campus alcohol policy and 106 coed volunteer students—completed measures assessing alcohol consumption, reasons for drinking, and consequences. Differential effects between genders were examined. Results: Social camaraderie ({SC}) was the most frequently endorsed reason for drinking. Regression analyses controlling for previous drinking revealed that social reasons for drinking predicted alcohol-related problems among female students in both samples. Additionally, {SC} was significantly correlated with every drinking measure and problem measure at 1 month for females in both the adjudicated and the volunteer groups. Total drinks, drinking days, and heavy episodic drinking events correlated with {SC} for males in the adjudicated sample. Conclusions: For females, these results suggest a relationship between social reasons for drinking and alcohol-related consequences, which previous research has not identified. More research is needed to explore females' reasons for drinking, accompanying problems, and the underlying psychosocial traits associated with these reasons. (J. Stud.

	abstract = {Background:  Alcohol-related harm is pervasive among college students in the United States of America and Canada, where a third to half of undergraduates binge drink at least fortnightly. There have been no national studies outside North America. We estimated the prevalence of binge drinking, related harms, and individual risk factors among undergraduates in New Zealand. Methods:  A web survey was completed by 2,548 undergraduates (63\% response) at 5 of New Zealand’s 8 universities. Drinking patterns and alcohol-related problems in the preceding 4 weeks were measured. Drinking diaries for the preceding 7 days were completed. Multivariate analyses were used to identify individual risk factors. Results:  A total of 81\% of both women and men drank in the previous 4 weeks, 37\% reported 1 or more binge episodes in the last week, 14\% of women and 15\% of men reported 2+ binge episodes in the last week, and 68\% scored in the hazardous range (4+) on the {AUDIT} consumption subscale. A mean of 1.8 (95\% confidence interval 1.4, 2.3) distinct alcohol-related risk behaviors or harmful consequences were reported, e.g., 33\% had a blackout, 6\% had unprotected sex, and 5\% said they were physically aggressive toward someone, in the preceding 4 weeks. Drink-driving or being the passenger of a drink-driver in the last 4 weeks was reported by 9\% of women and 11\% of men. Risk factors for frequent binge drinking included: lower age, earlier age of drinking onset, monthly or more frequent binge drinking in high school, and living in a residential hall or a shared house (relative to living with parents). These correlates were similar to those identified in U.S. and Canadian studies. Conclusions:  Strategies are needed to reduce the availability and promotion of alcohol on and around university campuses in New Zealand. Given the high prevalence of binge drinking in high school and its strong association with later binge drinking, strategies aimed at youth drinking are also a priority. In universities, high-risk drinkers should be identified and offered intervention early in their undergraduate careers.},

This article adopts a network approach to the study of risky behaviors exhibited among college students, particularly the excessive use of alcohol. Specifically, this investigation examines the role of to whom students are talking, with whom they are affiliated, and how frequently they are discussing potential effects of risky behaviors on the excessive use of alcohol. Two hundred thirty-nine undergraduate students completed a survey 1 week following an unofficial university-wide event celebrating the end of spring semester that traditionally revolves around the overconsumption of alcohol. Students were asked to report on a number of things, including their typical behaviors, behaviors they participated in at this particular event, and features of their social networks. Membership in Greek organizations on campus, the range of one's network, and the frequency of talking about drinking and potential consequences were all significantly related to drinking in excess. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed at the conclusion of the article.},

The current prospective study assesses the relationship between exposure to peers' alcohol-related {SMS} content and later-drinking among first-year college students. Among 408 first-year students, total exposure to peers' alcohol-related content on Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat during the initial 6weeks of college predicted alcohol consumption 6months later. The rather robust relationship persisted even after students' and close friends drinking were accounted for, indicating that alcohol references on {SMS} do not simply reflect alcohol use behaviors that would otherwise be observed in the absence of {SMS} and be predictive of later alcohol use. Findings also illuminate important gender differences in the degree to which peers' alcohol-related {SMS} content influenced later drinking behavior as well as psychological mediators of this relationship. Among females, enhancement drinking motives and beliefs about the role of alcohol in the college experience fully mediated the relationship between {SMS} alcohol exposure and later drinking. Males, however, evidenced a much stronger predictive relationship between {SMS} alcohol exposure and second semester drinking, with this relationship only partially explained by perceptions of drinking norms, enhancement drinking motives, and beliefs about the role of alcohol in the college experience. Implications of these findings for college drinking prevention efforts and directions for future research are discussed.},

In this paper, we examine whether sentiment occurring in social media content is associated with a user's information sharing behavior. We carry out our research in the context of political communication on Twitter. Based on two data sets of more than 165,000 tweets in total, we find that emotionally charged Twitter messages tend to be retweeted more often and more quickly compared to neutral ones. As a practical implication, companies should pay more attention to the analysis of sentiment related to their brands and products in social media communication as well as in designing advertising content that triggers emotions.},

Such differences may depend on the quality of information acquired, as well as individual variability in how cautiously evidence is evaluated. The current study examined neural activity while subjects accumulated sequential pieces of evidence and then made a decision. Uncertainty was updated with each piece of evidence, with individual ratings of subjective uncertainty characterizing underconfidence when observing evidence. Increased uncertainty during evidence accumulation was associated with activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, whereas greater uncertainty when executing a decision uniquely elicited lateral frontal and parietal activity. Greater underconfidence when observing evidence correlated with activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that neural mechanisms of uncertainty depend on the stage of decision-making (belief updating vs decision) and that greater subjective uncertainty when evaluating evidence is associated with activity in ventromedial brain regions, even in the absence of overt risk.},

	abstract = {People are motivated to adopt the most favorable beliefs about their future because positive beliefs are experienced as rewarding. However, it is so far inconclusive whether brain regions known to represent reward values are involved in the generation of optimistically biased belief updates. To address this question, we investigated neural correlates of belief updates that result in relatively better future outlooks, and therefore imply a positive subjective value of the judgment outcome. Participants estimated the probability of experiencing different adverse future events. After being provided with population base rates of these events, they had the opportunity to update their initial estimates. Participants made judgments concerning themselves or a similar other, and were confronted with desirable or undesirable base rates (i.e., lower or higher than their initial estimates). Belief updates were smaller following undesirable than desirable information, and this optimism bias was stronger for judgments regarding oneself than others. During updating, the positive value of self-related updates was reflected by neural activity in the subgenual ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({vmPFC}) that increased both with increasing sizes of favorable updates, and with decreasing sizes of unfavorable updates. During the processing of self-related undesirable base rates, increasing activity in a network including the dorsomedial {PFC}, hippocampus, thalamus and ventral striatum predicted decreasing update sizes. Thus, key regions of the neural reward circuitry contributed to the generation of optimistically biased self-referential belief updates. While the {vmPFC} tracked subjective values of belief updates, a network including the ventral striatum was involved in neglecting information calling for unfavorable updates.},

Priming a counterarguing mindset should induce people to refute their emerging preferences, thereby disrupting the operation of cognitive consistency. Five studies confirm this prediction. Study 1 demonstrates that priming a counterarguing mindset decreases information distortion. Studies 2 and 3 replicate Study 1 and further show that the influence of a head start on choice diminishes when counterarguing is primed. Study 4 shows that priming counterarguing inhibits consistency-related concepts.

Yet considerable research evidence suggests that overly positive self-evaluations, exaggerated perceptions of control or mastery, and unrealistic optimism are characteristic of normal human thought. Moreover, these illusions appear to promote other criteria of mental health, including the ability to care about others, the ability to be happy or contented, and the ability to engage in productive and creative work. These strategies may succeed, in large part, because both the social world and cognitive-processing mechanisms impose filters on incoming information that distort it in a positive direction; negative information may be isolated and represented in as unthreatening a manner as possible. These positive illusions may be especially useful when an individual receives negative feedback or is otherwise threatened and may be especially adaptive under these circumstances.},

	abstract = {Extant neural models of self-evaluation are dominated by associations with medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}) and posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC}) function and have mostly been developed from studies differentiating self-evaluation from evaluation of other people. Although self-evaluation is robustly characterized by systematic biases, current neural models of self-evaluation cannot speak to their neurobiology because of a lack of research. The few extant studies have made claims about associations between bias and ventral anterior cingulate cortex ({vACC}) function but have confounded bias with the valence of experimental stimuli. In study 1, {fMRI} was used to examine the neurobiology of the “above-average” effect, a robust self-evaluation bias. The majority of people judge their personality to be more desirable (i.e., more positive and less negative traits) than their peers' personalities. {MPFC} and {PCC} were significantly more activated by a condition that reduced susceptibility to “above-average” judgments. However, {MPFC} and {PFCC} activity were not modulated by individual differences in “above-average” judgments. {VACC} activity distinguished positive from negative valence but did not predict individual differences in “above-average” judgments. Instead, the extent to which participants viewed themselves as “above average” was negatively correlated with orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}) and, to a lesser extent, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ({dACC}) activation. A complementary study found that mental load increases “above-average” judgments (study 2). These findings are the first to directly examine the neural systems involved in social judgment bias and have implications for the association between frontal lobe dysfunction and poor insight.},

Without denying the uniqueness of each process, it is proposed that they constitute different forms of traversing psychological distance. Psychological distance is egocentric: Its reference point is the self in the here and now, and the different ways in which an object might be removed from that point—in time, in space, in social distance, and in hypotheticality—constitute different distance dimensions. Transcending the self in the here and now entails mental construal, and the farther removed an object is from direct experience, the higher (more abstract) the level of construal of that object. Supporting this analysis, research shows (a) that the various distances are cognitively related to each other, (b) that they similarly influence and are influenced by level of mental construal, and (c) that they similarly affect prediction, preference, and action.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive understanding of the neurobiology of alcohol cue reactivity is critical in identifying the neuropathology of alcohol use disorders ({AUD}) and developing treatments that may attenuate alcohol craving and reduce relapse risk. Functional neuroimaging studies have identified many brain areas in which alcohol cues elicit activation. However, extant studies have included relatively small numbers of cases, with {AUD} of varying severity, and have employed many different cue paradigms. We used activation likelihood estimation, a quantitative, coordinate-based meta-analytic method, to analyze the brain areas activated by alcohol-related cues across studies, and to examine whether these areas were differentially activated between cases and controls. Secondarily, we reviewed correlations between behavioral measures and cue-elicited activation, as well as treatment effects on such activation. Data analyzed were from 28 studies of 679 cases and 174 controls. Among cases, alcohol cues elicited robust activation of limbic and prefrontal regions, including ventral striatum, anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. As compared to controls, cases demonstrated greater activation of parietal and temporal regions, including posterior cingulate, precuneus and superior temporal gyrus. Cue-elicited activation of ventral striatum was most frequently correlated with behavioral measures and most frequently reduced by treatment, but these results were often derived from region-of-interest analyses that interrogated only limbic regions. These findings support long-standing theories of mesolimbic involvement in alcohol cue processing, but suggest that cue-elicited activation of other brain areas may more clearly differentiate cases from controls. Prevention and treatment for {AUD} should consider interventions that may reduce cue-elicited activation of these areas.},

	abstract = {Background: Alcohol is often consumed in social contexts. An emerging social context in which alcohol is becoming increasingly apparent is social media. More and more young people display alcohol-related posts on social networking sites such as Facebook and Instagram. Objective: Considering the importance of the social aspects of alcohol consumption and social media use, this study investigated the social content of alcohol posts (ie, the evaluative social context and presence of people) and social processes (ie, the posting of and reactions to posts) involved with alcohol posts on social networking sites. Methods: Participants (N=192; mean age 20.64, {SD} 4.68 years, 132 women and 54 men) gave researchers access to their Facebook and/or Instagram profiles, and an extensive content analysis of these profiles was conducted. Coders were trained and then coded all screenshotted timelines in terms of evaluative social context, presence of people, and reactions to post. Results: Alcohol posts of youth frequently depict alcohol in a positive social context (425/438, 97.0\%) and display people holding drinks (277/412, 67.2\%). In addition, alcohol posts were more often placed on participants’ timelines by others (tagging; 238/439, 54.2\%) than posted by participants themselves (201/439, 45.8\%). Furthermore, it was revealed that such social posts received more likes (mean 35.50, {SD} 26.39) and comments than nonsocial posts (no people visible; mean 10.34, {SD} 13.19, P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: In terms of content and processes, alcohol posts on social media are social in nature and a part of young people’s everyday social lives. Interventions aiming to decrease alcohol posts should therefore focus on the broad social context of individuals in which posting about alcohol takes place. Potential intervention strategies could involve making young people aware that when they post about social gatherings in which alcohol is visible and tag others, it may have unintended negative consequences and should be avoided.

This work, using a five-year dataset from Instagram, analyzes what machine-extracted textual and visual cues reveal about trends of casual drinking (concepts gathered around \#drink) and possible negative drinking (concepts gathered around \#drunk). Our analysis reveals that \#drunk posts occur more frequently in party occasions and nightlife locations, with a higher presence of people, while \#drink posts occur at food locations, with a higher presence of drink containers. Manual coding further shows that \#drunk posts have a higher chance of being perceived as potentially objectionable. A random forest classifier shows that \#drink and \#drunk posts can be discriminated with accuracy up to 82.3\%. These results have important implications for alcohol research among youth.},

Two experiments were conducted with volunteers in an interactive game of chance, in which a putative player won or lost more money than the participant. The results showed that even when participants lost money, they expressed joy and schadenfreude (gloating) if the other player had lost more money. On the other hand when they actually won money, but the other player had won more they expressed envy. This pattern was also demonstrated in a differential {BOLD} response in the ventral striatum. Comparing the activations between an actual gain and a relative gain indicated that even when a person loses money, merely adding information about another person's greater loss may increase ventral striatum activations to a point where these activations are similar to those of an actual gain. We suggest that the ventral striatum plays a role in mediating the emotional consequences of social comparison. Hum Brain Mapp, 2010. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background
Social smoking is increasingly prevalent and poses a challenge to traditional cessation practices. Tobacco companies conducted extensive research on social smokers long before health authorities did and marketed products to promote this smoking behavior.
Purpose
Research is described and mechanisms identified that are used to promote social smoking to help improve cessation strategies in this growing group.
Evidence acquisition
Searches from 2006 to 2008 of previously secret tobacco industry documents using keywords social smoker, light smoker, casual smoker, youth smoker, and occasional smoker, followed by snowball searching. Data analysis was conducted in 2008.
Evidence synthesis
Tobacco industry research identified characteristics of social smokers that include: (1) denial of personal nicotine addiction; (2) self-categorization as a nonsmoker; (3) propensity for decreased tobacco use in response to smoke-free laws; (4) variations in age, education, ethnicity, and socioeconomic backgrounds; and (5) a perceived immunity to personal health effects of tobacco but fear of consequences to others. Tobacco companies developed marketing strategies aimed at social smokers, including “non–habit forming” cigarettes.
Conclusions
Previously considered a transient behavior, social smoking is also a stable consumption pattern. Focused clinical questions to detect social smoking are needed and may include, “Have you smoked any cigarettes or used any tobacco products in the past month?” as opposed to “Are you a smoker?” Clinicians should recognize that social smokers might be motivated to quit after education on the dangers of secondhand smoke rather than on personal health risks or with pharmacotherapy.},

By using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined neural activity while participants updated their beliefs based on the decisions of two fictitious stock market traders and their own private information, which led to a final decision of buying one of two stocks. Computational modeling of the behavioral data showed that a majority of participants overweighted private information. Overweighting was negatively correlated with the probability of starting an informational cascade in trials especially prone to conformity. Belief updating by private information was related to activity in the inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex; the more a participant overweighted private information, the higher the activity in the inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula and the lower in the parietal-temporal cortex. This study explores the neural correlates of overweighting of private information, which underlies the tendency to start an informational cascade.},

Drawing from research on autism and neuroscience, the authors develop a model of brain functioning that differentiates better-skilled from less-skilled interpersonal mentalizers. They establish the convergent, discriminant, concurrent, predictive, and nomological validities of measures of the scale using four methods in four separate studies: confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, multitrait–multimethod matrix procedures, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. The study is one of the first to test the validity of measures of a scale not only in traditional ways but also by adopting procedures from neuroscience.},

In order to investigate this phenomenon, we measured how social influence predicts attitudes, use and further exercise in the context of gamification of exercise. Our results show that people indeed do “work out for likes”, or in other words, social influence, positive recognition and reciprocity have a positive impact on how much people are willing to exercise as well as their attitudes and willingness to use gamification services. Moreover, we found that the more friends a user has in the service, the larger the effects are. Furthermore, the findings of the empirical study further provide new understanding on the phenomenon of social influence in technology adoption/use continuance in general by showing, in addition to subjective norms, how getting recognized, receiving reciprocal benefits and network effects contribute to use continuance.},

	abstract = {Why do certain group members end up liking each other more than others? How does affective reciprocity arise in human groups? The prediction of interpersonal sentiment has been a long-standing pursuit in the social sciences. We combined {fMRI} and longitudinal social network data to test whether newly acquainted group members’ reward-related neural responses to images of one another’s faces predict their future interpersonal sentiment, even many months later. Specifically, we analyze associations between relationship-specific valuation activity and relationship-specific future liking. We found that one’s own future (T2) liking of a particular group member is predicted jointly by actor’s initial (T1) neural valuation of partner and by that partner’s initial (T1) neural valuation of actor. These actor and partner effects exhibited equivalent predictive strength and were robust when statistically controlling for each other, both individuals’ initial liking, and other potential drivers of liking. Behavioral findings indicated that liking was initially unreciprocated at T1 yet became strongly reciprocated by T2. The emergence of affective reciprocity was partly explained by the reciprocal pathways linking dyad members’ T1 neural data both to their own and to each other’s T2 liking outcomes. These findings elucidate interpersonal brain mechanisms that define how we ultimately end up liking particular interaction partners, how group members’ initially idiosyncratic sentiments become reciprocated, and more broadly, how dyads evolve. This study advances a flexible framework for researching the neural foundations of interpersonal sentiments and social relations that—conceptually, methodologically, and statistically—emphasizes group members’ neural interdependence.},

To address this question, we scanned forty-five adult smokers using functional magnetic resonance  imaging while they viewed antismoking images. Participants reported their smoking behavior and intentions to quit smoking before the scan and one month later. We focused on regions within four atlas-defined networks and examined whether they formed consistent network communities during this task (measured as allegiance). Smokers who showed reduced allegiance among regions within the default mode and frontoparietal networks also demonstrated larger increases in their intentions to quit smoking one month later. We further examined dynamics of the {VMPFC}, as activation in this region has been frequently related to behavior change. The degree to which {VMPFC} changed its community assignment over time (measured as flexibility) was positively associated with smoking reduction.

	abstract = {Young adults consume most of their alcohol by binge drinking, and more than one-third report binge drinking in the past month. Some will transition out of excessive drinking, while others will maintain or increase alcohol use into adulthood. Public health campaigns depicting negative consequences of drinking have shown some efficacy at reducing this behavior. However, substance use in dependent individuals is governed in part by automatic or habitual responses to drug cues rather than the consequences. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural responses to drinking cues and drinking cues paired with antidrinking messages among young adults who binge drink (N = 30). This study also explored responses to smoking cues and antismoking messages. Neural responses were also compared between drinking/smoking and neutral cues. Self-reported drinking and smoking were collected at baseline, postscan, and 1 month. Results indicate that activity in the ventral striatum-implicated in reward processing-was lower for drinking cues paired with antidrinking messages than drinking cues. This difference was less pronounced in young adults who reported greater baseline past month drinking quantity. Past month drinking quantity decreased from baseline to 1 month. Further, young adults who showed higher activity during antidrinking messages in the medial prefrontal cortex-implicated in processing message self-relevance- reported a greater decrease in past month drinking frequency from baseline to 1 month. Findings may help to identify young adults who are at risk for continued heavy drinking in adulthood and inform interventions aimed to reduce drinking and reward in young adults.},

	abstract = {It is generally agreed that social ties play a beneficial role in the maintenance of psychological well-being. In this targeted review, we highlight four sets of insights that emerge from the literature on social ties and mental health outcomes (defined as stress reactions, psychological well-being, and psychological distress, including depressive symptoms and anxiety). First, the pathways by which social networks and social supports influence mental health can be described by two alternative (although not mutually exclusive) causal models—the main effect model and the stress-buffering model. Second, the protective effects of social ties on mental health are not uniform across groups in society. Gender differences in support derived from social network participation may partly account for the higher prevalence of psychological distress among women compared to men. Social connections may paradoxically increase levels of mental illness symptoms among women with low resources, especially if such connections entail role strain associated with obligations to provide social support to others. Third, egocentric networks are nested within a broader structure of social relationships. The notion of social capital embraces the embeddedness of individual social ties within the broader social structure. Fourth, despite some successes reported in social support interventions to enhance mental health, further work is needed to deepen our understanding of the design, timing, and dose of interventions that work, as well as the characteristics of individuals who benefit the most.},

Since its first publication in 1998, the {WHO}-5 has been translated into more than 30 languages and has been used in research studies all over the world. We now provide a systematic review of the literature on the {WHO}-5. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} We conducted a systematic search for literature on the {WHO}-5 in {PubMed} and {PsycINFO} in accordance with the {PRISMA} guidelines. In our review of the identified articles, we focused particularly on the following aspects: (1) the clinimetric validity of the {WHO}-5; (2) the responsiveness/sensitivity of the {WHO}-5 in controlled clinical trials; (3) the potential of the {WHO}-5 as a screening tool for depression, and (4) the applicability of the {WHO}-5 across study fields. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} A total of 213 articles met the predefined criteria for inclusion in the review. The review demonstrated that the {WHO}-5 has high clinimetric validity, can be used as an outcome measure balancing the wanted and unwanted effects of treatments, is a sensitive and specific screening tool for depression and its applicability across study fields is very high. \textbf{\textit{Conclusions:}} The {WHO}-5 is a short questionnaire consisting of 5 simple and non-invasive questions, which tap into the subjective well-being of the respondents. The scale has adequate validity both as a screening tool for depression and as an outcome measure in clinical trials and has been applied successfully across a wide range of study fields.},

	abstract = {Contemporary commentators describe the current period as “an era of fake news” in which misinformation, generated intentionally or unintentionally, spreads rapidly. Although affecting all areas of life, it poses particular problems in the health arena, where it can delay or prevent effective care, in some cases threatening the lives of individuals. While examples of the rapid spread of misinformation date back to the earliest days of scientific medicine, the internet, by allowing instantaneous communication and powerful amplification has brought about a quantum change. In democracies where ideas compete in the marketplace for attention, accurate scientific information, which may be difficult to comprehend and even dull, is easily crowded out by sensationalized news. In order to uncover the current evidence and better understand the mechanism of misinformation spread, we report a systematic review of the nature and potential drivers of health-related misinformation. We searched {PubMed}, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus and Google databases to identify relevant methodological and empirical articles published between 2012 and 2018. A total of 57 articles were included for full-text analysis. Overall, we observe an increasing trend in published articles on health-related misinformation and the role of social media in its propagation. The most extensively studied topics involving misinformation relate to vaccination, Ebola and Zika Virus, although others, such as nutrition, cancer, fluoridation of water and smoking also featured. Studies adopted theoretical frameworks from psychology and network science, while co-citation analysis revealed potential for greater collaboration across fields. Most studies employed content analysis, social network analysis or experiments, drawing on disparate disciplinary paradigms. Future research should examine susceptibility of different sociodemographic groups to misinformation and understand the role of belief systems on the intention to spread misinformation. Further interdisciplinary research is also warranted to identify effective and tailored interventions to counter the spread of health-related misinformation online.},

Much research has developed frameworks for and proposed empirical guidelines on how brands should communicate and interact with audiences on social media platforms. However, a comprehensive study that is based on a successful and reputable brand is still lacking. The objective of this research was to categorise the types of content used by one of the most admired brands in the world, Starbucks, and evaluate its effectiveness on Twitter. In total, the author studied 565 tweets and retweets and 1392 replies. This research found that Starbucks’ marketing communications strategy includes three types of original and retweeted content: information-sharing, emotion-evoking, and action-inducing content. The author also found six types of replies: information, Apology and suppot, positive comment, question and enquiry, chit-chat, and gratitude. To be successful on the social media platforms, this research suggests that brands should use various types of content, focus on visual content, and prepare for and manage customer interactions appropriately. The findings present useful and practical information for brands that seek to engage audiences using an inexpensive but compelling marketing communications strategy on social media.},

We analyzed 10,141 political tweets, sent by 527 influencers between July 2019 and June 2020. The results reveal that content in which emotions are more prevalent than argument quality is more likely to be shared than content in which argument quality is prevalent. Perhaps surprisingly, we also show that content in which positive emotions are more prevalent than negative emotions is more likely to be shared than content in which negative emotions are prevalent. Moreover, authority (i.e., a dominant language style and a high number of followers) can lead to increased shares. Finally, we find that content in which positive emotions are more prevalent than negative emotions is less effective in increasing shares when users are located at the ideological extreme compared to the ideological center. On the one hand, we provide insights into how influencers in social media networks can be utilized for political campaigning. On the other hand, we provide insights into what makes users engage with political content from influencers that might contribute to political polarization on social media.},

	abstract = {The {COVID}-19 pandemic brought widespread attention to an “infodemic” of potential health misinformation. This claim has not been assessed based on evidence. We evaluated if health misinformation became more common during the pandemic. We gathered about 325 million posts sharing {URLs} from Twitter and Facebook during the beginning of the pandemic (March 8-May 1, 2020) compared to the same period in 2019. We relied on source credibility as an accepted proxy for misinformation across this database. Human annotators also coded a subsample of 3000 posts with {URLs} for misinformation. Posts about {COVID}-19 were 0.37 times as likely to link to “not credible” sources and 1.13 times more likely to link to “more credible” sources than prior to the pandemic. Posts linking to “not credible” sources were 3.67 times more likely to include misinformation compared to posts from “more credible” sources. Thus, during the earliest stages of the pandemic, when claims of an infodemic emerged, social media contained proportionally less misinformation than expected based on the prior year. Our results suggest that widespread health misinformation is not unique to {COVID}-19. Rather, it is a systemic feature of online health communication that can adversely impact public health behaviors and must therefore be addressed.},

Further, it maps existing knowledge about neural correlates and moderators of thought processes linked to individual and population-level sharing events and outcomes and suggests avenues for future investigation. Finally, the chapter discusses the potential of the neuroscience of information sharing to interact productively with other methodological traditions such as computational social science. Initial neuroimaging studies of information sharing provide insights into psychological mechanisms that were previously inaccessible.

	abstract = {Background
Sleep disturbance is associated with inflammatory disease risk and all-cause mortality. Here, we assess global evidence linking sleep disturbance, sleep duration, and inflammation in adult humans.
Methods
A systematic search of English language publications was performed, with inclusion of primary research articles that characterized sleep disturbance and/or sleep duration or performed experimental sleep deprivation and assessed inflammation by levels of circulating markers. Effect sizes ({ES}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) were extracted and pooled using a random effect model.
Results
A total of 72 studies (n {\textgreater} 50,000) were analyzed with assessment of C-reactive protein ({CRP}), interleukin-6 ({IL}-6), and tumor necrosis factor α ({TNFα}). Sleep disturbance was associated with higher levels of {CRP} ({ES} .12; 95\% {CI} = .05–.19) and {IL}-6 ({ES} .20; 95\% {CI} = .08–.31). Shorter sleep duration, but not the extreme of short sleep, was associated with higher levels of {CRP} ({ES} .09; 95\% {CI} = .01–.17) but not {IL}-6 ({ES} .03; 95\% {CI}: −.09 to .14). The extreme of long sleep duration was associated with higher levels of {CRP} ({ES} .17; 95\% {CI} = .01–.34) and {IL}-6 ({ES} .11; 95\% {CI} = .02–20). Neither sleep disturbances nor sleep duration was associated with {TNFα}. Neither experimental sleep deprivation nor sleep restriction was associated with {CRP}, {IL}-6, or {TNFα}. Some heterogeneity among studies was found, but there was no evidence of publication bias.
Conclusions
Sleep disturbance and long sleep duration, but not short sleep duration, are associated with increases in markers of systemic inflammation.},

	abstract = {A prerequisite for a pattern analysis using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data is estimating the patterns from time series data, which then are input into the pattern analysis. Here we focus on how the combination of study design (order and spacing of trials) with pattern estimator impacts the Type I error rate of the subsequent pattern analysis. When Type I errors are inflated, the results are no longer valid, so this work serves as a guide for designing and analyzing {MVPA} studies with controlled false positive rates. The {MVPA} strategies examined are pattern classification and similarity, utilizing single trial activation patterns from the same functional run. Primarily focusing on the Least Squares Single and Least Square All pattern estimators, we show that collinearities in the models, along with temporal autocorrelation, can cause false positive correlations between activation pattern estimates that adversely impact the false positive rates of pattern similarity and classification analyses. It may seem intuitive that increasing the interstimulus interval ({ISI}) would alleviate this issue, but remaining weak correlations between activation patterns persist and have a strong influence in pattern similarity analyses. Pattern similarity analyses using only activation patterns estimated from the same functional run of data are susceptible to inflated false positives unless trials are randomly ordered, with a different randomization for each subject. In other cases, where there is any structure to trial order, valid pattern similarity analysis results can only be obtained if similarity computations are restricted to pairs of activation patterns from independent runs. Likewise, for pattern classification, false positives are minimized when the testing and training sets in cross validation do not contain patterns estimated from the same run.},

	abstract = {Social media have provided instrumental means of communication in many recent political protests. The efficiency of online networks in disseminating timely information has been praised by many commentators; at the same time, users are often derided as “slacktivists” because of the shallow commitment involved in clicking a forwarding button. Here we consider the role of these peripheral online participants, the immense majority of users who surround the small epicenter of protests, representing layers of diminishing online activity around the committed minority. We analyze three datasets tracking protest communication in different languages and political contexts through the social media platform Twitter and employ a network decomposition technique to examine their hierarchical structure. We provide consistent evidence that peripheral participants are critical in increasing the reach of protest messages and generating online content at levels that are comparable to core participants. Although committed minorities may constitute the heart of protest movements, our results suggest that their success in maximizing the number of online citizens exposed to protest messages depends, at least in part, on activating the critical periphery. Peripheral users are less active on a per capita basis, but their power lies in their numbers: their aggregate contribution to the spread of protest messages is comparable in magnitude to that of core participants. An analysis of two other datasets unrelated to mass protests strengthens our interpretation that core-periphery dynamics are characteristically important in the context of collective action events. Theoretical models of diffusion in social networks would benefit from increased attention to the role of peripheral nodes in the propagation of information and behavior.},

In the present study, we further unpack the stereotype consistency bias by varying the relative group memberships of the communicator, target, and audience of a narrative and examine the effect of the communication of stereotype consistent and inconsistent information.

Although the issue has received some scholarly attention, there is a need to improve the conceptual precision in the increasingly blurry debate. The use of computational communication science approaches allows us to track political conversations in a fine-grained manner within their natural settings – the realm of interactive social media. The present study combines different algorithmic approaches to studying social media data in order to capture both the interactional structure and content of dynamic political talk online. We conducted an analysis of political polarization across social media platforms (analyzing Facebook, Twitter, and {WhatsApp}) over 16 months, with close to a quarter million online contributions regarding a political controversy in Israel. Our comprehensive measurement of interactive political talk enables us to address three key aspects of political polarization: (1) interactional polarization – homophilic versus heterophilic user interactions; (2) positional polarization – the positions expressed, and (3) affective polarization – the emotions and attitudes expressed. Our findings indicate that political polarization on social media cannot be conceptualized as a unified phenomenon, as there are significant cross-platform differences. While interactions on Twitter largely conform to established expectations (homophilic interaction patterns, aggravating positional polarization, pronounced inter-group hostility), on {WhatsApp}, de-polarization occurred over time. Surprisingly, Facebook was found to be the least homophilic platform in terms of interactions, positions, and emotions expressed. Our analysis points to key conceptual distinctions and raises important questions about the drivers and dynamics of political polarization online.},

We also show that cooperative interparty interactions – whether imagined or vicarious – have limited advantage over simple positive contact (studies 2 and 3), that negative interparty contact exacerbates outgroup hostility by enhancing anxiety and reducing empathy (study 2), and that interactions with one’s political in group are not necessarily polarizing (study 3).

Contrary to a self-categorization account, this manipulation of outgroup salience did not affect the degree of group polarization. In addition, rating measures revealed little spontaneous consideration of outgroup positions on the part of participants, nor was consideration of outgroup positions related to degree of polarization. Group members did show evidence of ingroup identification, but this identification was unrelated to participants' post-discussion conformity to the group consensus.

Management Rev. 23(2):325–340], suggests that in teams with strong faultlines the mechanisms of homophilous selection of interaction partners and persuasive influence cause subgroup polarization, defined as the split of the team into subgroups holding opposing opinions. The second, from sociological and anthropological traditions, emphasizes that crisscrossing actors bridge faultlines because they share demographic attributes with several subgroups. Demographically crisscrossing actors help to prevent polarization in social groups. We argue that Lau and Murnighan’s theory implicitly factors in the effects of crisscrossing actors. However, we show that the authors overlooked crucial implications of their theory because they did not consider crisscrossing actors explicitly. Most importantly, we demonstrate that demographic crisscrossing implies that even teams with strong faultlines will overcome polarization in the long run, although they might suffer from it in the short term. We develop and analyze a formal computational model of the opinion and network dynamics in work teams to show the consistency of our reasoning with Lau and Murnighans’ theory. The model also revealed another counterintuitive effect: strong faultlines lead to structures of interaction that make teams with strong faultlines faster in arriving at a stable consensus than teams with weak faultlines.},

Several studies empirically observed the existence of echo chambers in online social media, stimulating a slew of works that tries to model the phenomenon via opinion modeling. Here, we propose a model of opinion dynamics centered around the notion that opinion changes are invoked by news exposure. Our model comes with parameters for opinions and connection strength which are updated through news propagation. We simulate the propagation of multiple news under the model in synthetic networks and observe the evolution of the model’s parameters and the propagation structure induced. Unlike previous models, our model successfully exhibited not only polarization of opinion, but also segregated propagation structure. By analyzing the results of our simulations, we found that the formation probability of echo chambers is primarily connected to the news polarization. However, it is also affected by intolerance to dissimilar opinions and how quickly individuals update their opinions. Through simulations on Twitter networks, we found that the behavior of the model is reproducible across different network structure and sizes.},

In the current study, we present the first large-scale confirmatory replication of the {GBM}. Specifically, we conducted a consensus message experiment on a national quota sample of the {US} population (N = 6,301). Results support the mediational hypotheses of the {GBM}: an experimentally induced change in perceived scientific consensus causes subsequent changes in cognitive (belief) and affective (worry) judgments about climate change, which in turn are associated with changes in support for public action. The scientific consensus message also had a direct effect on support for public action. We further found an interaction with both political ideology and prior attitudes such that conservatives and climate change disbelievers were more likely to update their beliefs toward the consensus. We discuss the model's theoretical and practical implications, including why conveying scientific consensus can help reduce politically motivated reasoning.},

	abstract = {Data from two {MTurk} studies with U.S. respondents (total N =1,153) revealed an ideological divide in adherence to social distancing guidelines during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Specifically, political conservatism inversely predicted compliance with behaviors aimed at preventing the spread of the {COVID}-19. Differences in reported social distancing were mediated by divergent perceptions of the health risk posed by {COVID}-19 (Studies 1 and 2), which were explained by differences in self-reported knowledge of {COVID}-19 (Study 1) and perceived media accuracy in covering the pandemic (Studies 1 and 2). The politicization of {COVID}-19 may have prompted conservatives to discount mainstream media reports of the severity of the virus, leading them to downplay its health risks and consequently adherence less to social distancing protocols. These effects hold when controlling for key demographic characteristics as well as psychological variables, including belief in science and {COVID}-19-related anxiety. Thus, political ideology may uniquely explain {COVID}-19 behavior.},

Corrections are less effective if the misinformation was attributed to a credible source, the misinformation has been repeated multiple times prior to correction, or when there was a time lag between the delivery of the misinformation and the correction.

At the same time, there are limits to our understanding of this phenomenon in multiparty contexts. How do citizens draw the line between 'ingroups' and 'outgroups' in fragmented contexts with multiple parties? Answering this question has been hampered by a relative lack of data on citizens' views towards compatriots with opposing political views outside the {US}. This study is based on original data collection, measuring citizens’ evaluations of various political and non-political outgroups among a population-representative sample of 1071 Dutch citizens. These data allow to study the extent and configuration of affective polarization in the highly fragmented context of the Netherlands. The analysis shows that respondents do distinguish between parties and partisans. They report more dislike towards political outgroups than towards almost all non-political outgroups. Rather than disliking all out-partisans equally, evaluations grow gradually colder as ideological distance towards a group increases. Affective polarization is especially strong between those who disagree on cultural issues, and between those who support and oppose the populist radical right. The article discusses how these findings enhance our understanding of affective polarization in multiparty systems.},

	abstract = {Rising political polarization in recent decades has hampered and gridlocked policymaking, as well as weakened trust in democratic institutions. These developments have been linked to the idea that new media technology fosters extreme views and political conflict by facilitating self-segregation into “echo chambers” where opinions are isolated and reinforced. This opinion-centered picture has recently been challenged by an emerging political science literature on “affective polarization”, which suggests that current polarization is better understood as driven by partisanship emerging as a strong social identity. Through this lens, politics has become a question of competing social groups rather than differences in policy position. Contrary to the opinion-centered view, this identity-centered perspective has not been subject to dynamical formal modeling, which generally permits hypotheses about micro-level explanations for macro-level phenomena to be systematically tested and explored. We here propose a formal model that links new information technology to affective polarization via social psychological mechanisms of social identity. Our results suggest that new information technology catalyzes affective polarization by lowering search and interaction costs, which shifts the balance between centrifugal and centripetal forces of social identity. We find that the macro-dynamics of social identity is characterized by two stable regimes on the societal level: one fluid regime, in which identities are weak and social connections heterogeneous, and one solid regime in which identities are strong and groups homogeneous. We also find evidence of hysteresis, meaning that a transition into a fragmented state is not readily reversed by again increasing those costs. This suggests that, due to systemic feedback effects, if polarization passes certain tipping points, we may experience run-away political polarization that is highly difficult to reverse.},

	url = {https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/5903},
	abstract = {Previous research on attentional biases to alcohol images has used heterogenous sets of stimuli (e.g. a beer can in isolation, a group of people drinking, etc.). However, beverage preference plays an important part in determining an individual's alcohol use pattern and thus might be expected to influence attentional biases. The purpose of this study was to determine if beverage preferences affect event-related potential ({ERP}) indices of cue reactivity to different types of alcohol images (e.g. beer, wine, and liquor) in binge drinkers ({BDs}). The secondary purpose was to examine the possibility of gender differences in cue reactivity. Fourteen {BDs} (7 male, 7 female) completed a modified Go/No-Go task using preferred and non-preferred alcohol-related stimuli, and nonalcoholic beverages as control stimuli. It was predicted that reactivity preferred beverages would be enhanced, manifested as higher N2 and P3 {ERP} amplitudes relative to non-preferred. Male {BDs} were predicted to have impaired response inhibition and higher reactivity to preferred images than female {BDs}. Larger N2, but not P3, amplitudes to preferred alcohol-related stimuli were observed, indicative of increased attentional capture. Female {BDs} produced larger No-Go P3 amplitudes in response to alcohol-related stimuli, indicating they had greater response inhibition than males to these stimuli. These findings suggest that beverage preference is a factor in the attentional bias of {BDs}. The results provide new information which could prove beneficial in preventing and treating alcohol use disorders ({AUD}).},

Modulating this activation might be a promising option in the treatment of alcohol addiction. One approach might be real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback ({rtfMRI} {NF}). This study was set up to implement and evaluate a {rtfMRI} approach in a group of non-addicted heavy social drinkers. Thirty-eight heavy drinking students were assigned to a real feedback group ({rFB}, n = 13), a yoke feedback group ({yFB}, n = 13) and a passive control group ({noFB}, n = 12). After conducting a reward task as functional localizer to identify ventral striatal regions, the participants viewed alcohol cues during three {NF} training blocks in a 3 T {MRI} scanner. The {rFB} group received feedback from their own and the {yFB} from another participants' {VS}. The {noFB} group received no feedback. The {rFB} and the {yFB} groups were instructed to downregulate the displayed activation. Activation of the {VS} and prefrontal control regions was compared between the groups. We found significant downregulation of striatal regions specifically in the {rFB} group. While the {rFB} and the {yFB} groups showed significant activation of prefrontal regions during feedback, this activation was only correlated to the reduction of striatal activation in the {rFB} group. We conclude that {rtfMRI} {NF} is a suitable method to reduce striatal activation to alcohol cues. It might be a promising supplement to the treatment of alcoholic patients.},

Here, we examined whole-brain blood oxygen level-dependent ({BOLD}) responses to behavioural cues in individuals with {AUD} and in healthy controls ({HCs}). The participants included 24 patients with {AUD} and 15 {HCs}. We presented visual cues consisting of four beverage-related images (juice, drinking juice, sake, and drinking sake), and the cue reactivity of {AUD} participants was contrasted with that of {HC} participants. Multiple comparisons revealed that the {AUD} group had lower {BOLD} responses than the {HC} group in the left precuneus (p = 0.036) and the left posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC}) (p = 0.044) to images of drinking juice and higher {BOLD} responses than the {HC} group in the left {PCC} (p = 0.044) to images of drinking sake. Furthermore, compared to the {HCs}, the {AUD} patients had decreased {BOLD} responses associated with cue reactivity to drinking juice in the left precuneus during the periods from 15 to 18 s (p = 0.004, df = 37) and 18 to 21 s (p = 0.002, df = 37). Our findings suggest that {HCs} and {AUD} patients differ in their responses not to images of alcoholic beverages but to images related to alcohol-drinking behaviour. Thus, these patients appear to have different patterns of brain activity. This information may aid clinicians in developing treatments for patients with {AUD}.},

	abstract = {Introduction With the progression of substance dependence, drug cue-related brain activation is thought to shift from motivational towards habit pathways. However, a direct association between cue-induced brain activation and dependence duration has not yet been shown. We therefore examined the relationship between alcohol cue-reactivity in the brain, cue-induced subjective craving and alcohol dependence duration and severity. Since alcohol dependence is highly comorbid with depression/anxiety, which may modulate brain responses to alcohol cues, we also examined the relation between comorbid depression/anxiety and cue-reactivity. Methods We compared 30 alcohol dependent patients with 15 healthy controls and 15 depression/anxiety patients during a visual alcohol cue-reactivity task using functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygenated level-dependent responses and subjective craving as outcomes. Within the alcohol dependent group we correlated cue-reactivity with alcohol dependence severity and duration, with cue-induced craving and with depression/anxiety levels. Results Alcohol dependent patients showed greater cue-reactivity in motivational brain pathways and stronger subjective craving than depression/anxiety patients and healthy controls. Depression/anxiety was not associated with cue-reactivity, but depression severity in alcohol dependent patients was positively associated with craving. Within alcohol dependence, longer duration of alcohol dependence was associated with stronger cue-related activation of the posterior putamen, a structure involved in habits, whereas higher alcohol dependence severity was associated with lower cue-reactivity in the anterior putamen, an area implicated in goal-directed behavior preceding habit formation. Conclusion Cue-reactivity in alcohol dependence is not modulated by comorbid depression or anxiety. More importantly, the current data confirm the hypothesis of a ventral to dorsal striatal shift of learning processes with longer dependence duration, which could underlie increasingly habitual substance use with progressing substance dependence.},

Emerging evidence suggests that implicit measures may offer additional insight in predicting unique variance in alcohol outcomes.

The current study examined the predictive validity of three alcohol-related associations (e.g., drinking identity, alcohol approach, and alcohol cope) using adaptations of the Implicit Association Test ({IAT}) in a sample of 243 undergraduates. Confirming previous findings, drinking identity associations were the most consistent predictor of alcohol consumption and alcohol problems. They were the only associations that were unique predictors of alcohol use after controlling for other implicit associations. In comparison, alcohol cope and alcohol approach associations were weak but consistent predictors of alcohol consumption and alcohol problems. Although positively correlated with all drinking outcomes, neither set of associations predicted unique variance in the drinking outcomes when all implicit associations were included in the same model. Collectively, these results extend previous findings that implicit drinking identity may be a powerful tool for predicting alcohol outcomes and a potential target for clinical intervention and prevention efforts.},

The study finds several new empirical generalizations about advertising elasticity. The most important are as follows: the average short-term advertising elasticity is .12, which is substantially lower than the prior meta-analytic mean of .22; there has been a decline in the advertising elasticity over time; and advertising elasticity is higher (1) for durable goods than nondurable goods, (2) in the early stage than the mature stage of the life cycle, (3) for yearly data than quarterly data, and (4) when advertising is measured in gross rating points than monetary terms. The mean long-term advertising elasticity is .24, which is much lower than the implied mean in the prior meta-analysis (.41). many of the results for short-term elasticity hold for long-term elasticity, with some notable exceptions. The authors discuss the implications of these findings.},

Backfire effects are more pronounced when audiences highly identify with noncompliant actors or pay more attention to others’ behaviors. We also show that injunctive norms should be included to alleviate backfire effects. The studies suggest that governments and authorities can more effectively encourage compliance with health guidelines by focusing on the majority of compliant individuals rather than broadcasting images of noncompliant individuals.},

Insights into how to debunk this type of misinformation can especially be crucial for public health crises.

After initial misinformation exposure, participants’ exposure to corrective information type (simple rebuttal vs. factual elaboration) and source (government health agency vs. news media vs. social peer) was varied, including a control group without corrective information. Results show that, if corrective information is present rather than absent, incorrect beliefs based on misinformation are debunked and the exposure to factual elaboration, compared to simple rebuttal, stimulates intentions to take protective actions. Moreover, government agency and news media sources are found to be more successful in improving belief accuracy compared to social peers. The observed mediating role of crisis emotions reveals the mechanism underlying the effects of corrective information.

	abstract = {Background
Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders globally and has implications for various aspects of everyday-life. To date, studies assessing the association between social relationships and depression have provided conflicting results. The aim of this paper was to review the evidence on associations between social relationships and depression in the general population.
Methods
Studies investigating the association of social support, social networks, or social connectedness with depression were retrieved and summarized (searches using Pubmed, {ScienceDirect}, {PsycNet} were conducted in May 2014).
Results
Fifty-one studies were included in this review. The strongest and most consistent findings were significant protective effects of perceived emotional support, perceived instrumental support, and large, diverse social networks. Little evidence was found on whether social connectedness is related to depression, as was also the case for negative interactions.
Limitations
Due to the strict inclusion criteria relating to study quality and the availability of papers in the domain of interest, the review did not capture ‘gray literature’ and qualitative studies.
Conclusion
Future research is warranted to account for potential bias introduced by the use of subjective measures as compared to objective measures of received support and actual networks. Due to the heterogeneity between available studies on the measure of social relationships, the inclusion of comparable measures across studies would allow for more valid comparisons. In addition, well-designed prospective studies will provide more insight into causality. Future research should address how social support and networks interact and together affect risks for depression. Social connectedness and negative interactions appear to be underutilized as measures in population-based studies.},

	abstract = {A growing body of research shows that social networks and identities have a profound impact on mental and physical health. With such mounting evidence of the importance of social relationships in protecting health, the challenge we face is explaining why this should be the case. What is it that social groups offer that appears to be just as beneficial as a daily dose of vitamin C or regular exercise? This edited book brings together the latest research on how group memberships, and the social identities associated with them, determine people’s health and well-being. The volume provides a variety of perspectives from clinical, social, organisational and applied fields that offer theoretical and empirical insights into these processes and their consequences. The contributions present a rich and novel analysis of core theoretical issues relating to the ways in which social identities, and factors associated with them (such as social support and a sense of community), can bolster individuals’ sense of self and contribute to physical and mental health. In this way it is shown how social identities constitute a ‘social cure’, capable of promoting adjustment, coping and well-being for individuals dealing with a range of illnesses, injuries, trauma and stressors. In addition, these theories provide a platform for practical strategies that can maintain and enhance well-being, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Contributors to the book are at the forefront of these developments and the book’s strength derives from its analysis of factors that shape the health and well-being of a broad range of groups. It presents powerful insights which have important implications for health, clinical, social and organisational psychology and a range of cognate fields.},

We review selected evidence on the nature of social relationships and focus on one particular facet of the connection continuum – the extent to which an individual feels isolated (i.e., feels lonely) in a social world. Evidence indicates that loneliness heightens sensitivity to social threats and motivates the renewal of social connections, but it can also impair executive functioning, sleep, and mental and physical well-being. Together, these effects contribute to higher rates of morbidity and mortality in lonely older adults.},

	abstract = {In the outbreak of infectious diseases such as {COVID}-19, social media channels are important tools for the public to obtain information and form their opinions on infection risk, which can affect their disease prevention behaviors and the consequent disease transmission processes. However, there has been a lack of theoretical investigation into how social media and human behaviors jointly affect the spread of infectious diseases. In this study, we develop an agent-based modeling framework that couples (1) a general opinion dynamics model that describes how individuals form their opinions on epidemic risk with various information sources, (2) a behavioral adoption model that simulates the adoption of disease prevention behaviors, and (3) an epidemiological {SEIR} model that simulates the spread of diseases in a host population. Through simulating the spread of a coronavirus-like disease in a hypothetical residential area, the modeling results show that social media can make a community more sensitive to external drivers. Social media can increase the public's awareness of infection risk, which is beneficial for epidemic containment, when high-quality epidemic information exists at the early stage of pandemics. However, fabricated and fake news on social media, after a “latent period”, can lead to a significant increase in infection rate. The modeling results provide scientific evidence for the intricate interplay between social media and human behaviors in epidemic dynamics and control, and highlight the importance of public education to promote behavioral changes and the need to correct misinformation and fake news on social media in a timely manner.},

Primarily, we hope to reveal characteristics of existing studies investigating the health topics that consumers have discussed in social media, ascertaining the roles social media have played in consumers’ information-seeking processes and discussing the potential benefits and concerns of accessing consumer health information in social media. Methods The Web of Science Core Collection database was searched for existing literature on consumer health information seeking in social media. The search returned 214 articles, of which 21 met the eligibility criteria following review of full-text documents. Conclusion Between 2011 and 2016, twenty-one studies published explored various topics related to consumer information seeking in social media. These ranged from online discussions on specific diseases (e.g. diabetes) to public health concerns (e.g. pesticide residues). Consumers’ information needs vary depending on the health issues of interest. Benefits of health seeking on social media, in addition to filling a need for health information, include the social and emotional support health consumers gain from peer-to-peer interactions. These benefits, however, are tempered by concerns of information quality and authority and lead to decreased consumer engagement.},

	abstract = {Recent statistics show that almost 1/4 of a million people have died and four million people are affected either with mild or serious health problems caused by coronavirus ({COVID}-19). These numbers are rapidly increasing (World Health Organization, May 3, 2020c). There is much concern during this pandemic about the spread of misleading or inaccurate information. This article reports on a small study which attempted to identify the types and sources of {COVID}-19 misinformation. The authors identified and analysed 1225 pieces of {COVID}-19 fake news stories taken from fact-checkers, myth-busters and {COVID}-19 dashboards. The study is significant given the concern raised by the {WHO} Director-General that ‘we are not just fighting the pandemic, we are also fighting infodemic’. The study concludes that the {COVID}-19 infodemic is full of false claims, half backed conspiracy theories and pseudoscientific therapies, regarding the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, origin and spread of the virus. Fake news is pervasive in social media, putting public health at risk. The scale of the crisis and ubiquity of the misleading information require that scientists, health information professionals and journalists exercise their professional responsibility to help the general public identify fake news stories. They should ensure that accurate information is published and disseminated.J.M.},

The distinct emotions induced by different news frames influenced individuals’ information processing (i.e., heuristic vs. systematic processing) and the evaluation of the company differently. Participants exposed to anger-inducing crisis news read the news less closely and had more negative attitudes toward the company than those exposed to sadness-inducing news. Also, emotional frames affected how individuals perceived the different types of corporate responses (relief-focused message vs. punishment-focused message; emotional appeal vs. no emotional appeal). The advantage of emotional appeals was found contingent on how the crisis was previously framed by the media. Findings demonstrate a potential for developing effective corporate response strategies in a given crisis situation, considering the type of crisis, how it has been framed by the media, the publics’ emotional responses, and the use of emotional appeals.},

	abstract = {To better understand not only the minds, but also the hearts of key publics, we have developed a more systemic approach to understand the responses of audiences in crisis situations. The Integrated Crisis Mapping ({ICM}) model is based on a publics-based, emotion-driven perspective where the publics' responses to different crises are mapped on 2 continua, the organization's engagement in the crisis and primary publics' coping strategy. This multistage testing found evidence that anxiety was the default emotion that publics felt in crises. The subsequent emotions felt by the publics varied in different quadrants involving different crisis types. As far as coping strategies were concerned, conative coping was more evident than cognitive coping across the 4 quadrants. Evidence also suggested strong merit that conative coping was the external manifestation of the internal cognitive processing that had taken place. Cognitive coping was thus the antecedent of conative coping. Although both the publics and the organizations agreed that the crises were relevant to the organizations' goals, they differed on who should assume more responsibility. The findings, although still very much exploratory, suggest theoretical rigor in the model, with room for further refinements to generate what Yin (2003) termed “analytic generalization” (p. 33) for the {ICM} model.},

The literature review included 65 relevant studies (N= approximately 30,000) that represented over 20 health issues. The mean overall effect size (d+= 0.52) was of moderate magnitude. In general, increases in threat severity, threat vulnerability, response efficacy, and self-efficacy facilitated adaptive intentions or behaviors. Conversely, decreases in maladaptive response rewards and adaptive response costs increased adaptive intentions or behaviors. This held true whether the measures were based on intentions or behaviors, and suggests that {PMT} components may be useful for individual and community interventions.},

Design and setting: Face-to-face interviews with a random and representative sample of the South Australian population in 2004, compared with a similarly conducted survey in 1998 that used the same vignette, questions and methodology. Participants: 3015 randomly selected participants, aged 15 years and over. Main outcome measures: Responses to both open-ended and direct questions about symptoms and treatment options for depression. Results: The 3015 interviews conducted represented a response rate of 65.9\%. Compared with 1998, in 2004 there was a significant increase in the proportion of people recognising depression in the vignette, acknowledging personal experience of depression, and perceiving professional assistance to be more helpful and less harmful. However, although more people nominated psychiatrists or psychologists as therapists of choice, the difference between 1998 and 2004 was not significant. Conclusions: There has been a significant increase in mental health literacy, at least as regards depression, in the South Australian community between 1998 and 2004. The lack of significant change in psychiatrists and/or psychologists being perceived as therapists of choice is of concern and suggests that community education about their expertise may be appropriate.},

Informed by the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication Model and Health Belief Model, it proposes a conceptual model to study how people in Wuhan – the first epicenter of the global {COVID}-19 pandemic – used social media and its effects on users' mental health conditions and health behavior change. The results show that social media usage was related to both depression and secondary trauma, which also predicted health behavior change. But no relation was detected between health behavior change and mental health conditions. As the virus struck, social media usage was rewarding to Wuhan people who gained informational, emotional, and peer support from the health information shared on social media. An excessive use of social media, however, led to mental health issues. The results imply that taking a social media break may promote well-being during the pandemic, which is crucial to mitigating mental health harm inflicted by the pandemic.},

Social network platforms, where users can express their emotions, feelings, and thoughts, are a valuable source of data for researching mental health, and techniques based on machine learning are increasingly used for this purpose. Objective: The objective of this review was to explore the scope and limits of cutting-edge techniques that researchers are using for predictive analytics in mental health and to review associated issues, such as ethical concerns, in this area of research. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review in March 2017, using keywords to search articles on data mining of social network data in the context of common mental health disorders, published between 2010 and March 8, 2017 in medical and computer science journals. Results: The initial search returned a total of 5386 articles. Following a careful analysis of the titles, abstracts, and main texts, we selected 48 articles for review. We coded the articles according to key characteristics, techniques used for data collection, data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, model construction, and model verification. The most common analytical method was text analysis, with several studies using different flavors of image analysis and social interaction graph analysis. Conclusions: Despite an increasing number of studies investigating mental health issues using social network data, some common problems persist. Assembling large, high-quality datasets of social media users with mental disorder is problematic, not only due to biases associated with the collection methods, but also with regard to managing consent and selecting appropriate analytics techniques.},

	abstract = {Social media is a huge force in the lives of young people with wide ranging effects on their development; given the importance of adolescence in the genesis of mental illness, social media is a factor in the mental health of young people. Despite the role that social media obviously plays in the development of mental illness, little research has been done into the impact that social media has on in the mental illness of young people. In general, what research there is points towards social media having a large impact on young people in both positive and negative ways. In particular, certain studies show a greater incidence and severity of bullying online compared to offline which may contribute to the development of depression. This contrasts with the positive impact that social media seems to have for young people in minority groups (ethnic minorities and those with chronic disease or disability) by allowing them to connect with others who live similar lives despite geographical separation. This acts as a positive influence in these people's lives though a direct link to mental illness was not shown. Overall, several important issues are raised: firstly, the lack of research that has been conducted in the area; secondly, the gulf that exists between the generation of younger, 'digital native' generations and the older generations who are not as engaged with social media; and finally, the huge potential that exists for the use of social media as a protective influence for adolescents. With proper engagement, policy makers and health professionals could use social media to connect with young people on issues like mental health.},

	abstract = {Background: Social networking sites ({SNSs}) have the potential to increase the reach and efficiency of essential public health services, such as surveillance, research, and communication. Objective: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review to identify the use of {SNSs} for public health research and practice and to identify existing knowledge gaps. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review of articles related to public health and {SNSs} using {PubMed}, {EMBASE}, and {CINAHL} to search for peer-reviewed publications describing the use of {SNSs} for public health research and practice. We also conducted manual searches of relevant publications. Each publication was independently reviewed by 2 researchers for inclusion and extracted relevant study data. Results: A total of 73 articles met our inclusion criteria. Most articles (n=50) were published in the final 2 years covered by our search. In all, 58 articles were in the domain of public health research and 15 were in public health practice. Only 1 study was conducted in a low-income country. Most articles (63/73, 86\%) described observational studies involving users or usages of {SNSs}; only 5 studies involved randomized controlled trials. A large proportion (43/73, 59\%) of the identified studies included populations considered hard to reach, such as young individuals, adolescents, and individuals at risk of sexually transmitted diseases or alcohol and substance abuse. Few articles (2/73, 3\%) described using the multidirectional communication potential of {SNSs} to engage study populations. Conclusions: The number of publications about public health uses for {SNSs} has been steadily increasing in the past 5 years. With few exceptions, the literature largely consists of observational studies describing users and usages of {SNSs} regarding topics of public health interest. More studies that fully exploit the communication tools embedded in {SNSs} and study their potential to produce significant effects in the overall population\&\#8217;s health are needed.},

	abstract = {Background
Little research exists on social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) use among individuals with serious mental illnesses ({SMI}). One particular question of interest is the extent to which online social media use is associated with these individuals' community participation, civic engagement and psychosocial outcomes.
Methods
Two-hundred and thirty-two individuals with {SMI} receiving services at 18 mental health organizations throughout the continental U.S. completed questionnaires on their community participation, civic engagement, quality of life, loneliness, and psychiatric symptoms. They were also asked which social media sites they used; the duration, frequency and importance of, and reasons for, social media use; and the number of contacts they had on social media.
Results
Approximately a third of the sample reported having at least one social media account. Greater frequency, intensity and longevity of social media were associated with higher levels of community participation, and greater intensity of social media use was positively associated with civic engagement. For instance, those who used social media at least 30 min a day had 16.4 more days of participation and voting rates that were higher by 17.4\%. Social media use was not found to be significantly associated with loneliness, psychiatric symptoms or quality of life.
Discussion and implications
Greater social media use appears to be associated with greater community engagement without negative repercussions on loneliness, symptoms, or quality of life. Interventions that support social media use among individuals with {SMI} could have important community integration benefits.},

	abstract = {Aim Social media holds promise for expanding the reach of mental health services, especially for young people who frequently use these popular platforms. We surveyed social media users who self-identified as having a mental illness to learn about their use of social media for mental health and to identify opportunities to augment existing mental health services. Methods We asked 240 Twitter users who self-identified in their profile as having a mental illness to participate in an online survey. The survey was in English and inquired about participants’ mental health condition, use of social media for mental health and interest in accessing mental health programs delivered through social media. Results Respondents from 10 countries completed 135 surveys. Most respondents were from the United States (54\%), Canada (22\%) and the United Kingdom (17\%) and reported a psychiatric diagnosis of either schizophrenia spectrum disorder (27\%), bipolar disorder (25\%), major depressive disorder (16\%) or depression (20\%). Young adults age ≤35 (46\%) were more likely to use Instagram (P = .002), Snapchat (P {\textless} .001) and their mobile phone for accessing social media (P {\textless} .001) compared to adults age 36 and older (53\%). Most participants (85\%) expressed interest in mental health programs delivered through social media, especially to promote overall health and wellbeing (72\%) and for coping with mental health symptoms (90\%). Conclusions This exploratory study demonstrates the feasibility of reaching social media users with mental illness and can inform efforts to leverage social media to make evidence-based mental health services more widely available to those in need.},

	abstract = {How are social interaction dynamics associated with mental health during early stages of adolescence? The goal of this study is to objectively measure social interactions and evaluate the roles that multiple aspects of the social environment – such as physical activity and food choice – may jointly play in shaping the structure of children's relationships and their mental health. The data in this study are drawn from a longitudinal network-behavior study conducted in 2012 at a private K-8 school in an urban setting in California. We recruited a highly complete network sample of sixth-graders (n = 40, 91\% of grade, mean age = 12.3), and examined how two measures of distressed mental health (self-esteem and depressive symptoms) are positionally distributed in an early adolescent interaction network. We ascertained how distressed mental health shapes the structure of relationships over a three-month period, adjusting for relevant dimensions of the social environment. Cross-sectional analyses of interaction networks revealed that self-esteem and depressive symptoms are differentially stratified by gender. Specifically, girls with more depressive symptoms have interactions consistent with social inhibition, while boys' interactions suggest robustness to depressive symptoms. Girls higher in self-esteem tended towards greater sociability. Longitudinal network behavior models indicate that gender similarity and perceived popularity are influential in the formation of social ties. Greater school connectedness predicts the development of self-esteem, though social ties contribute to more self-esteem improvement among students who identify as European-American. Cross-sectional evidence shows associations between distressed mental health and students' network peers. However, there is no evidence that connected students' mental health status becomes more similar in their over time because of their network interactions. These findings suggest that mental health during early adolescence may be less subject to mechanisms of social influence than network research in even slightly older adolescents currently indicates.},

	abstract = {Research on political judgment and decision-making has converged with decades of research in clinical and social psychology suggesting the ubiquity of emotion-biased motivated reasoning. Motivated reasoning is a form of implicit emotion regulation in which the brain converges on judgments that minimize negative and maximize positive affect states associated with threat to or attainment of motives. To what extent motivated reasoning engages neural circuits involved in “cold” reasoning and conscious emotion regulation (e.g., suppression) is, however, unknown. We used functional neuroimaging to study the neural responses of 30 committed partisans during the U.S. Presidential election of 2004. We presented subjects with reasoning tasks involving judgments about information threatening to their own candidate, the opposing candidate, or neutral control targets. Motivated reasoning was associated with activations of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex, and lateral orbital cortex. As predicted, motivated reasoning was not associated with neural activity in regions previously linked to cold reasoning tasks and conscious (explicit) emotion regulation. The findings provide the first neuroimaging evidence for phenomena variously described as motivated reasoning, implicit emotion regulation, and psychological defense. They suggest that motivated reasoning is qualitatively distinct from reasoning when people do not have a strong emotional stake in the conclusions reached.},

	abstract = {Social distancing and isolation have been widely introduced to counter the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Adverse social, psychological and economic consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown demand the development of more moderate contact-reduction policies. Adopting a social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three distancing strategies designed to keep the curve flat and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. These are: limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts akin to forming social bubbles; seeking similarity across contacts; and strengthening communities via triadic strategies. We simulate stochastic infection curves incorporating core elements from infection models, ideal-type social network models and statistical relational event models. We demonstrate that a strategic social network-based reduction of contact strongly enhances the effectiveness of social distancing measures while keeping risks lower. We provide scientific evidence for effective social distancing that can be applied in public health messaging and that can mitigate negative consequences of social isolation.},

	abstract = {In the ongoing {COVID}-19 pandemic, many have experienced anxiety and distress by media reports. Feeling distressed by information may lead to avoidance of information, which has been shown to undermine adherence to preventive health behaviors, such as cancer screenings. We set out to examine whether feeling distressed by information predicts higher avoidance of information about {COVID}-19 (avoidance hypothesis), and whether this, in turn, predicts worse adherence to measures intended to prevent the spread of {COVID}-19 (adherence hypothesis). We conducted an online survey (N = 1059) and assessed distress by information ({CSS}-15-burden subscale), information avoidance, and adherence to preventive behaviors. Furthermore, we inquired about participants’ information seeking behavior and media usage, trust in media sources, level of {eHealth} literacy ({eHEALS}), and generalized anxiety ({GAD}-7). We conducted multiple linear regression analyses for hypothesis testing and to examine what variables predicted distress by information. Also, we explored the role of trust in media sources and {eHealth} literacy. Supporting our hypotheses, higher distress by information predicted more information avoidance (avoidance hypothesis), and information avoidance predicted worse adherence to preventive measures (adherence hypothesis). Moreover, individuals with higher {eHealth} literacy reported higher trust in the media sources used, less distress by information, and less information avoidance. These findings provide insights into the consequences of distress by information and avoidance of information during a global health crisis. Results imply that information avoidance may be a maladaptive response to distress by information, which may go on to interfere with effective crisis management. We emphasize the need to develop measures to counteract information avoidance.},

The proposed model was tested using partial least square structural equation modeling ({PLS}-{SEM}) for which data were collected from 321 Finnish adults using an online survey. People found to seek information from traditional sources such as mass media, print media, and online sources such as official websites and websites of newspapers and forums. Social media and personal networks were not the preferred sources. On the other hand, among different information sources, social media exposure has a significant relationship with information overload as well as information anxiety.

	abstract = {The December, 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.},

	abstract = {The ongoing {COVID}-19 pandemic has brought forward the centrality of public communication as a force for information, and in highlighting the differential impact on diverse segments of the society. Information and communication technologies-led developments including social media have previously been discussed as instruments of democratization of knowledge. However, the evidence so far shows that the promise remains unfulfilled as upper socioeconomic groups acquire information at a faster rate than others. The communication inequalities have only reinforced the existing societal fault lines of race, class and place.As the first pandemic of the social media age, {COVID}-19 has also given rise to an “infodemic”, providing fertile ground for the spread of information, misinformation and disinformation. With limited gatekeeping, an immense amount of unprocessed scientific information is being put forward to publics not trained in science.In this commentary, we offer some propositions on how disinformation on {COVID}-19 has become mainstreamed through social media’s spiral of amplification and what role public communication has in an emergency from a lens of equity. We raise the question of whether the tremendous flow of scientific information during the {COVID}-19 pandemic has a differential impact on different socioeconomic groups. We propose that more systematic research is urgently needed to understand how mis/disinformation originate, spread and what their consequences are. In our view, research in health communication inequalities is foundational to mitigating the current off-line and online ravages of the pandemic.},

	abstract = {Background: The ongoing pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on global society, health care, governments, and mass media. Public dissemination of government policies, medical interventions, and misinformation has been remarkably rapid and largely unregulated during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, resulting in increased misinterpretations, miscommunication, and public panic. Being the first full-scale global pandemic of the digital age, {COVID}-19 has presented novel challenges pertinent to government advice, the spread of news and misinformation, and the trade-off between the accessibility of science and the premature public use of unproven medical interventions. 
Objective: This study aims to assess the use of internet search terms relating to {COVID}-19 information and misinformation during the global pandemic, identify which were most used in six affected countries, investigate any temporal trends and the likely propagators of key search terms, and determine any correlation between the per capita cases and deaths with the adoption of these search terms in each of the six countries.
Methods: This study uses relative search volume data extracted from Google Trends for search terms linked to the {COVID}-19 pandemic alongside per capita case and mortality data extracted from the European Open Data Portal to identify the temporal dynamics of the spread of news and misinformation during the global pandemic in six affected countries (Australia, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). A correlation analysis was carried out to ascertain any correlation between the temporal trends of search term use and the rise of per capita mortality and disease cases.
Results: Of the selected search terms, most were searched immediately following promotion by governments, public figures, or viral circulation of information, but also in relation to the publication of scientific resources, which were sometimes misinterpreted before further dissemination. Strong correlations were identified between the volume of these {COVID}-19–related search terms (overall mean Spearman rho 0.753, {SD} 0.158), and per capita mortality (mean per capita deaths Spearman rho 0.690, {SD} 0.168) and cases (mean per capita cases Spearman rho 0.800, {SD} 0.112).
Conclusions: These findings illustrate the increased rate and volume of the public consumption of novel information during a global health care crisis. The positive correlation between mortality and online searching, particularly in countries with lower {COVID}-19 testing rates, may demonstrate the imperative to safeguard official communications and dispel misinformation in these countries. Online news, government briefings, and social media provide a powerful tool for the dissemination of important information to the public during pandemics, but their misuse and the presentation of misrepresented medical information should be monitored, minimized, and addressed to safeguard public safety. Ultimately, governments, public health authorities, and scientists have a moral imperative to safeguard the truth and maintain an accessible discourse with the public to limit fear.},

	abstract = {The worldwide spread of a new coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) since December 2019 has posed a severe threat to individuals’ well-being. While the world at large is waiting that the released vaccines immunize most citizens, public health experts suggest that, in the meantime, it is only through behavior change that the spread of {COVID}-19 can be controlled. Importantly, the required behaviors are aimed not only at safeguarding one’s own health. Instead, individuals are asked to adapt their behaviors to protect the community at large. This raises the question of which social concerns and moral principles make people willing to do so. We considered in 23 countries (N = 6948) individuals’ willingness to engage in prescribed and discretionary behaviors, as well as country-level and individual-level factors that might drive such behavioral intentions. Results from multilevel multiple regressions, with country as the nesting variable, showed that publicized number of infections were not significantly related to individual intentions to comply with the prescribed measures and intentions to engage in discretionary prosocial behaviors. Instead, psychological differences in terms of trust in government, citizens, and in particular toward science predicted individuals’ behavioral intentions across countries. The more people endorsed moral principles of fairness and care (vs. loyalty and authority), the more they were inclined to report trust in science, which, in turn, statistically predicted prescribed and discretionary behavioral intentions. Results have implications for the type of intervention and public communication strategies that should be most effective to induce the behavioral changes that are needed to control the {COVID}-19 outbreak.},

Across countries adherence and subsequent mortality increases correlated with r = -0.91. No African or South American countries were included in the present study, which limits the generalizability of the findings.

Surveys of the general public, conducted two weeks after the first reported deaths from coronavirus in Taiwan and the United States, provide data for a comparative test of this proposed moderated mediation model. These data confirm that, compared with the United States, the government in Taiwan engaged in more effective communication during these early stages, and exposure to that effective communication triggered the proposed, customized, empowering five-step process among Taiwanese but not among U.S. populations. Among Taiwanese communication recipients (cf. U.S.), the five-step mediation effect is significant, such that exposure to government information → perceived government empowerment → intrapersonal empowerment → preventive behaviors → reduced vulnerability and worry.},

	shorttitle = {Social determinants of health},
	abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic has affected many countries with increasing morbidity and mortality. Interestingly, many of the actions and policies adopted in countries are linked to the social determinants of health ({SDH}). The {SDH} are critical determinants of health and health inequalities that are not directly within the health sector. Policies such as social distancing, good hygiene, avoiding large gatherings, cancelling of social and sports events, using personal protective equipment, schools and restaurants closure, country lockdown, etc. are not necessarily within the health sector but have been promoted to prevent and attenuate {COVID}-19 infection rates significantly. The {SDH} that serve to reduce morbidity will forestall or substantially reduce the pressure on many weak health systems in developing countries that cannot cope with increased hospitalisation and intensive health care. This paper argues that one of the most critical social determinants of health (i.e. effective crisis and risk communication), is crucial in many developing countries, including those with fewer confirmed coronavirus cases. We note that the effectiveness of many of the other {SDH} in reducing the burden of the {COVID}-19 pandemic hinges on effective communication, especially crisis and risk communication. Although many countries are adopting different communication strategies during the {COVID}-19 crisis, effective crisis and risk communication will lead to building trust, credibility, honesty, transparency, and accountability. The peculiarity of many developing countries in terms of regional, cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity is an essential consideration in ensuring effective crisis and risk communication. Developing countries facing significant poverty and disease burden cannot afford to handle the burgeoning of {COVID}-19 infections and must take preventive measures seriously. Thus, we submit that there is a need to intensify {SDH} actions and ensure that no one is left behind when communicating crisis and risk to the population to address the {COVID}-19 pandemic.},

Early risk communication scholars found acceptability of risk was shaped by 2 key components: hazard and outrage. The number of people who are exposed, infected, and fall ill can be considered the hazard. How the public and patients and respond to messages regarding risk mitigation relates to outrage. Social and cultural factors, immediacy, uncertainty, familiarity, personal control, scientific uncertainty, and trust in institutions and media all shape perception and response to risk mesaging. Outrage factors influence the ever-changing public understanding of {COVID}-19 risk. In concert, hazard and outrage along with cultural and economic context shape adherence to, and overall acceptance of, personal mitigation strategies including wearing facemasks and social distancing among the general public. The spread of misinformation on social media also provides both challenges and opportunities for clinicians. Social media offers an opportunity for experts to quickly convey true information about hazards, but offers others the opportunity to counter this with the spread of misinformation and exacerbate outrage. We propose strategies for infectious diseases clinicians to apply risk communication principles and frameworks to improve patient care and public message development in response to {COVID}-19.},

Based on the idea that positive mood encourages and negative mood discourages pursuit of accessible goals, we predicted that when participants were in positive moods, interpersonal goals and the apparent beliefs of an interaction partner would interactively shape participants' racial prejudice. In contrast, when participants were in negative moods, interpersonal goals and the apparent beliefs of an interaction partner were not expected to impact racial prejudice. Results of two experiments supported these predictions. Other ways that mood may shape affiliative social tuning are discussed.},

	abstract = {After tuning their message to suit their audience's attitude, communicators' own memories for the original information (e.g., a target person's behaviors) often reflect the biased view expressed in their message--producing an audience-congruent memory bias. Exploring the motivational circumstances of message production, the authors investigated whether this bias depends on the goals driving audience tuning. In 4 experiments, the memory bias was found to a greater extent when audience tuning served the creation of a shared reality than when it served alternative, nonshared reality goals (being polite toward a stigmatized-group audience; obtaining incentives; being entertaining; complying with a blatant demand). In addition, the authors found that these effects were mediated by the epistemic trust in the audience-congruent view but not by the rehearsal or accurate retrieval of the original input information, the ability to discriminate between the original and the message information, or a contrast away from extremely tuned messages. The central role of epistemic trust, a measure of the communicators' experience of shared reality, was supported in meta-analyses across the experiments.

In the context of personnel assessment in an organization, we examined the role of audience characteristics in this audience-tuning effect. Student communicators tuned their description of an employee to either an equal-status audience (a student temp) or a higher-status audience (a company board member). Audience-tuning occurred under both conditions, but a memory bias was found only in the equal-status condition. This audience-status effect was mediated by epistemic and relational trust in the audience. Apparently, the equal-status audience, while lacking domain-specific expertise, qualifies as a more trustworthy partner in creating a shared reality, which fulfills both epistemic and affiliative motives.},

	doi = {10.1109/BigData.2015.7363914},
	abstract = {Underage drinking or adolescent alcohol use is a major public health problem that causes more than 4,300 annual deaths. Traditional methods for monitoring adolescent alcohol consumption are based on surveys, which have many limitations and are difficult to scale. The main limitations include 1) respondents may not provide accurate, honest answers, 2) surveys with closed-ended questions may have a lower validity rate than other question types, 3) respondents who choose to respond may be different from those who chose not to respond, thus creating bias, 4) cost, 5) small sample size, and 6) lack of temporal sensitivity. We propose a novel approach to monitoring underage alcohol use by analyzing Instagram users' contents in order to overcome many of the limitations of surveys. First, Instagram users' demographics (such as age, gender and race) are determined by analyzing their selfie photos with automatic face detection and face analysis techniques supplied by a state-of-the-art face processing toolkit called Face++. Next, the tags associated with the pictures uploaded by users are used to identify the posts related to alcohol consumption and discover the existence of drinking patterns in terms of time, frequency and location. To that end, we have built an extensive dictionary of drinking activities based on internet slang and major alcohol brands. Finally, we measure the penetration of alcohol brands among underage users within Instagram by analyzing the followers of such brands in order to evaluate to what extent they might influence their followers' drinking behaviors. Experimental results using a large number of Instagram users have revealed several findings that are consistent with those of the conventional surveys, thus partially validating the proposed approach. Moreover, new insights are obtained that may help develop effective intervention. We believe that this approach can be effectively applied to other domains of public health.},

The current study sought to identify effective message types to pair with social media alcohol ads to minimise purchase intentions associated with exposure. Methods A 6 (within) × 5 (between) randomised controlled experiment was conducted with n = 723 {US} participants. Participants viewed six unique social media alcohol ads and were randomised to view one of four message types (i.e. pro-drinking comments, anti-drinking comments, industry responsibility messages and health warning labels) associated with the ads or the control (i.e. no messages). Purchase intentions were measured after each ad exposure. Significant main and interactive effects were determined by two-level, random intercept hierarchical linear models. Results Purchase intentions were significantly lower among participants who viewed anti-drinking comments relative to the control (P = 0.022) and warning labels (P = 0.016). Purchase intentions were significantly greater among participants who viewed pro-drinking comments and had a family history of alcohol use (P = 0.032) and among those who viewed warning labels and were previously exposed to alcohol depictions through family and friends' social media posts (P = 0.033). Discussion and Conclusions Anti-drinking messages, written by social media users, may be effective at reducing alcohol purchase intentions when posted as social media comments. Current industry responsibility messages had no effect, and caution may be needed if warning labels are applied to ads in this medium.},

First, the results indicate that Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and {WhatsApp} are positively related to alcohol use through attitudes and social norms towards alcohol use. Second, Snapchat and {WhatsApp} also appear to be associated with binge drinking.

	abstract = {Aim
To examine students' exposure to user-generated alcohol content on social media, and identify characteristics (i.e. demographics, personality traits, alcohol use, alcohol-related cognitions, and social media factors) associated with monthly or more frequent exposure.
Method
College/university students (N=11,236) in Bergen, Norway, completed a web-survey measuring exposure to alcohol on social media – both frequency and interpretations of alcohol content. The survey included questions regarding demographics, personality, alcohol-related cognitions, and general use of social media and alcohol. Binary logistic regressions were run to identify characteristics associated with monthly or more frequent exposure to alcohol-related posts on social media.
Results
A total of 96.7\% had been exposed to alcohol-related posts, exposure to posts with a positive valence of alcohol were more frequently reported than exposure to content with a negative valence of alcohol. Reports of monthly or more frequent exposure to alcohol on social media were associated with a range of characteristics, among these younger age, being native Norwegian, lower extroversion and higher agreeableness and self-monitoring scores, higher alcohol use, stronger descriptive norms for alcohol use among online-friends, and more frequent logins to social media.
Conclusions
Students' potential inflated alcohol norms (originating from social media) should be addressed. The results suggest that exposure may be determined by high alcohol use and membership in demographical groups associated with high alcohol use, an increased attentiveness towards others' behavior, and excessive social media use. Future studies investigating the relationship between alcohol exposure on social media and later alcohol use should control for such factors.},

	abstract = {Research has shown that young people post a lot of alcohol-related posts (i.e., alcoholposts) on social media and these posts have been shown to increase drinking behaviors. Because social influencers (i.e., individuals with the potential to influence large audiences on social media), may have a strong influence on young people it is important to know whether and how often they post about alcohol. Furthermore, because by using influencers alcohol brands may have found a way to circumvent regulations that prohibit advertising for minors, it is important to understand whether alcohol brands are visible in influencers’ posts and whether influencers use disclosures (e.g., “\#ad”) to notify viewers. In a content analysis of Instagram posts of 178 popular influencers, we investigated 1.) how many and how often influencers post about alcohol, 2.) what type of influencers post about alcohol, 3.) what the characteristics of influencers’ alcoholposts are, and 4.) to what extent these alcoholposts are commercialized (e.g., by showing brands and sponsorship disclosures). Results showed four main findings: 1.) The majority of influencers (i.e., 63.5\%) posted about alcohol recently. 2.) Alcoholposts were positive, showed a social context, and were mostly posted by lifestyle influencers. 3.) Although a fair amount of alcoholposts (19.5\%) showed a clear alcohol brand, only a few of these posts disclosed this as an advertisement, and even fewer gave an educational slogan (i.e., “\#no18noalcohol”). 4.) Posts with sponsorship disclosures yielded fewer likes and comments than posts without such disclosures. A post-hoc additional study that focused solely on minors confirmed these conclusions. These findings suggest that there is a lot to be concerned about in this context, especially since many minors can be exposed to influencers’ alcoholposts, potentially leading to increased drinking among this vulnerable age group. We therefore advice future researchers to further investigate this topic, and propose that legislation for alcohol advertising needs to be adjusted to account for the context of social networking sites.},

	abstract = {Despite the pervasive use of social media by young adults, there is comparatively little known about whether, and how, engagement in social media influences this group's drinking patterns and risk of alcohol-related problems. We examined the relations between young adults’ alcohol-related social media engagement (defined as the posting, liking, commenting, and viewing of alcohol-related social media content) and their drinking behavior and problems. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the association of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems with alcohol-related social media engagement. Summary baseline variables regarding the social media platform used (e.g., Facebook and Twitter), social media measures assessed (e.g., number of alcohol photographs posted), alcohol measures (e.g., Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and Timeline Follow back Interview), and the number of time points at which data were collected were extracted from each published study. We used the Q statistic to examine heterogeneity in the correlations between alcohol-related social media engagement and both drinking behavior and alcohol-related problems. Because there was significant heterogeneity, we used a random-effects model to evaluate the difference from zero of the weighted aggregate correlations. We used metaregression with study characteristics as moderators to test for moderators of the observed heterogeneity. Following screening, 19 articles met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The primary findings indicated a statistically significant relationship and moderate effect sizes between alcohol-related social media engagement and both alcohol consumption (r = 0.36, 95\% {CI}: 0.29 to 0.44, p {\textless} 0.001) and alcohol-related problems (r = 0.37, 95\% {CI}: 0.21 to 0.51, p {\textless} 0.001). There was significant heterogeneity among studies. Two significant predictors of heterogeneity were (i) whether there was joint measurement of alcohol-related social media engagement and drinking behavior or these were measured on different occasions and (ii) whether measurements were taken by self-report or observation of social media engagement. We found moderate-sized effects across the 19 studies: Greater alcohol-related social media engagement was correlated with both greater self-reported drinking and alcohol-related problems. Further research to determine the causal direction of these associations could provide opportunities for social media-based interventions with young drinkers aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related adverse consequences.},

	abstract = {Studies examining representations of college drinking on social media have almost exclusively focused on Facebook. However, recent research suggests college students may be more influenced by peers' alcohol-related posts on Instagram and Snapchat, two image-based platforms popular among this demographic. One potential explanation for this differential influence is that qualitative distinctions in the types of alcohol-related content posted by students on these three platforms may exist. Informed by undergraduate focus groups, this study examined the hypothesis that, of the three platforms, students tend to use Instagram most often for photos glamourizing drinking and Snapchat for incriminating photos of alcohol misuse and negative consequences. Undergraduate research assistants aided investigators in developing hypothetical vignettes and photographic examples of posts both glamorizing and depicting negative consequences associated with college drinking. In an online survey, vignette and photo stimuli were followed by counterbalanced paired comparisons that presented each possible pair of social media platforms. Undergraduates (N=196) selected the platform from each pair on which they would be more likely to see each post. Generalized Bradley-Terry models examined the probabilities of platform selections. As predicted, Instagram was seen as the most probable destination (and Facebook least probable) for photos depicting alcohol use as attractive and glamorous. Conversely, Snapchat was selected as the most probable destination (and Facebook least probable) for items depicting negative consequences associated with heavy drinking. Results suggest researchers aiming to mitigate the potential influences associated with college students' glamorous and consequential alcohol-related photos posted social media posts should shift their focus from Facebook to Instagram and Snapchat.},

	abstract = {Background Alcohol research may benefit from controlled and validated picture sets. We have constructed the Amsterdam Beverage Picture Set ({ABPS}), which was designed for alcohol research in general and cognitive bias measurement and modification in particular. Here, we first formulate a position on alcohol stimulus validity that prescribes that alcohol-containing pictures, compared to nonalcohol-containing pictures, should induce a stronger urge to drink in heavy drinkers than in light drinkers. Because a perceptually simple picture might induce stronger cognitive biases but the presence of a drinking context might induce a stronger urge to drink, the {ABPS} contains pictures with and without drinking context. By limiting drinking contexts to simple consumption scenes instead of real-life scenes, complexity was minimized. A validation study was conducted to establish validity, to examine {ABPS} drinking contexts, and to explore the role of familiarity, valence, arousal, and control. Methods Two hundred ninety-one psychology students completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, as well as rating and recognition tasks for a subset of the {ABPS} pictures. Results The {ABPS} was well-recognized, familiar, and heavy drinkers reported a greater urge to drink in response to the alcohol-containing pictures only. Alcohol presented in drinking context did not elicit a stronger urge to drink but was recognized more slowly than alcohol presented without context. Conclusions The {ABPS} was found to be valid, although pictures without context might be preferable for measuring cognitive biases than pictures with context. We discuss how an explicit approach to picture construction may aid in creating variations of the {ABPS}. Finally, we describe how {ABPS} adoption across studies may allow more reproducible and comparable results across paradigms, while allowing researchers to apply picture selection criteria that correspond to a wide range of theoretical positions. The latter is exemplified by {ABPS} derivatives and adoptions that are currently under way.},

	abstract = {Objective: The concurrent, construct, and discriminant validity of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ({AUDIT}) were evaluated. {AUDIT} consists of a 10-item Core questionnaire and an 8-item Clinical procedure. {AUDIT} was designed to identify hazardous drinkers (whose drinking increases their risk of alcohol-related problems, though alcohol-associated harm has not yet occurred); harmful drinkers (who have had recent physical or mental harm from their drinking, but who are not alcohol-dependent); and people with alcohol dependence. Method: Known alcoholics (n = 65) and general medical patients (n = 187) completed self-report questionnaires and underwent a diagnostic interview, physical examination and laboratory testing. Results: {AUDIT} scores correlated significantly with scores on the {MAST} and {MacAndrew} alcoholism screening tests, and with {ALAT}, {ASAT}, {GGT} and {MCV} levels, which reflect recent heavy drinking. {AUDIT} scores were correlated with measures of alcoholism vulnerability (e.g., familial alcoholism and sociopathy), and with somatic and affective consequences of drinking. Receiver operating characteristic and discriminant function analyses indicated that the {AUDIT} Core and Clinical Instruments were sensitive and specific in discriminating alcoholics from medical patients, most of whom were nonalcoholics. The {AUDIT} Core was superior to the {MAST} and the {AUDIT} Clinical in discriminating hazardous drinkers from nonhazardous drinkers. It was also superior to the {AUDIT} Clinical in discriminating harmful from nonharmful drinkers. Conclusions: The {AUDIT} Core Instrument is useful for early detection of hazardous or harmful drinking, while the {AUDIT} Clinical Instrument is better applied to identification and/or confirmation of cases of alcohol dependence.},

	abstract = {We investigate the relation between the sentiment of a message on social media and its virality, defined as the volume and speed of message diffusion. We analyze 4.1 million messages (tweets) obtained from Twitter. Although factors affecting message diffusion on social media have been studied previously, we focus on message sentiment and reveal how the polarity of message sentiment affects its virality. The virality of a message is characterized by the number of message repostings (retweets) and the time elapsed from the original posting of a message to its Nth reposting (N-retweet time). Through extensive analysis using the 4.1 million tweets and their retweets in 1 week, we discover that negative messages are likely to be reposted more rapidly and frequently than positive and neutral messages. Specifically, the reposting volume of negative messages is 20–60\% higher than that of positive and neutral messages, and negative messages spread 25\% faster than positive and neutral messages when the diffusion volume is quite high. We also perform longitudinal analysis of message diffusion observed over 1 year and find that recurrent diffusion of negative messages is less frequent than that of positive and neutral messages. Moreover, we present a simple message diffusion model that can reproduce the characteristics of message diffusion observed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Altruistic behavior, i.e., promoting the welfare of others at a cost to oneself, is subserved by the integration of various social, affective, and economic factors represented in extensive brain regions. However, it is unclear how different regions interact to process/integrate information regarding the helper's interest and recipient's need when deciding whether to behave altruistically. Here we combined an interactive game with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI}) and transcranial direct current stimulation ({tDCS}) to characterize the neural network underlying the processing/integration of self-interest and other-need. At the behavioral level, high self-risk decreased helping behavior and high other-need increased helping behavior. At the neural level, activity in medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}) and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({rDLPFC}) were positively associated with self-risk levels, and activity in right inferior parietal lobe ({rIPL}) and {rDLPFC} were negatively associated with other-need levels. Dynamic causal modeling further suggested that both {MPFC} and {rIPL} were extrinsically connected to {rDLPFC}; high self-risk enhanced the effective connectivity from {MPFC} to {rDLPFC}, and the modulatory effect of other-need on the connectivity from {rIPL} to {rDLPFC} positively correlated with the modulatory effect of other-need on individuals’ helping rate. Two {tDCS} experiments provided causal evidence that {rDLPFC} affects both self-interest and other-need concerns, and {rIPL} selectively affects the other-need concerns. These findings suggest a crucial role of the {MPFC}-{IPL}-{DLPFC} network during altruistic decision-making, with {rDLPFC} as a central node for integrating and modulating motives regarding self-interest and other-need.},

Experiments from behavioral economics have shown that choices involving gains and losses follow different policy rules, suggesting that appetitive and aversive processes might rely on different brain systems. Here we contrast this hypothesis with recent neuroscience studies exploring the human brain from brainstem nuclei to cortical areas. A strict anatomical divide seems difficult to draw, as appetitive and aversive stimuli appear to be processed in a flexible manner that depends on a context-wise subjective reference point. However, some valence specificity can be defined in the sense that net values (discounting appetitive by aversive values) are signaled with enhanced activity in some circuits, versus reduced activity in others. This dichotomy might explain why drugs or lesions can produce valence-specific effects, biasing decisions towards approaching a reward or avoiding a punishment.},

	abstract = {Excessive avoidance and diminished approach behavior are both prominent features of anxiety, trauma and stress related disorders. Despite this, little is known about the neuronal mechanisms supporting gating of human approach–avoidance behavior. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to track dorsal anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal ({dACC}/{dmPFC}) activation along an approach–avoidance continuum to assess sensitivity to competing appetitive and aversive contingencies and correspondence with behavior change. Behavioral and {fMRI} experiments were conducted using a novel approach–avoidance task where a monetary reward appeared in the presence of a conditioned stimulus ({CS}), or threat, that signaled increasing probability of unconditioned stimulus ({US}) delivery. Approach produced the reward or probabilistic {US}, while avoidance prevented {US} delivery, and across trials, reward remained fixed while the {CS} threat level varied unpredictably. Increasing the {CS} threat level (i.e., {US} probability) produced the desired approach–avoidance transition and inverted U-shaped changes in decision times, electrodermal activity and activation in pregenual {ACC}, {dACC}/{dmPFC}, striatum, anterior insula and inferior frontal regions. Conversely, U-shaped changes in activation were observed in dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex and bimodal changes in the orbitofrontal and ventral hippocampus. These new results show parallel dorsal–ventral frontal circuits support gating of human approach–avoidance behavior where {dACC}/{dmPFC} signals inversely correlate with value differences between approach and avoidance contingencies while ventral frontal signals correlate with the value of predictable outcomes. Our findings provide an important bridge between basic research on brain mechanisms of value-guided decision-making and value-focused clinical theories of anxiety and related interventions.},

	abstract = {Rewards in real life are rarely received without incurring costs and successful reward harvesting often involves weighing and minimizing different types of costs. In the natural environment, such costs often include the physical effort required to obtain rewards and potential risks attached to them. Costs may also include potential risks. In this study, we applied {fMRI} to explore the neural coding of physical effort costs as opposed to costs associated with risky rewards. Using an incentive-compatible valuation mechanism, we separately measured the subjective costs associated with effortful and risky options. As expected, subjective costs of options increased with both increasing effort and increasing risk. Despite the similar nature of behavioral discounting of effort and risk, distinct regions of the brain coded these two cost types separately, with anterior insula primarily processing risk costs and midcingulate and supplementary motor area ({SMA}) processing effort costs. To investigate integration of the two cost types, we also presented participants with options that combined effortful and risky elements. We found that the frontal pole integrates effort and risk costs through functional coupling with the {SMA} and insula. The degree to which the latter two regions influenced frontal pole activity correlated with participant-specific behavioral sensitivity to effort and risk costs. These data support the notion that, although physical effort costs may appear to be behaviorally similar to other types of costs, such as risk, they are treated separately at the neural level and are integrated only if there is a need to do so.},

Yet, a host of other reward factors—likely represented outside of {VMPFC}—must be integrated to construct such signals for valuation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), we tested whether the interactions between posterior {VMPFC} and functionally connected brain regions predict subjective value. During {fMRI} scanning, participants rated the attractiveness of unfamiliar faces. We found that activation in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior {VMPFC} and caudate increased with higher attractiveness ratings. Using data from a post-scan task in which participants spent money to view attractive faces, we quantified each individual’s subjective value for attractiveness. We found that connectivity between posterior {VMPFC} and regions frequently modulated by social information—including the temporal-parietal junction ({TPJ}) and middle temporal gyrus—was correlated with individual differences in subjective value. Crucially, these additional regions explained unique variation in subjective value beyond that extracted from value regions alone. These findings indicate not only that posterior {VMPFC} interacts with additional brain regions during valuation, but also that these additional regions carry information employed to construct the subjective value for social reward.},

Behavioral data suggest that choices are made by computing the value of the different attributes and then integrating them into an overall stimulus value signal. However, it is not known whether this theory describes the way the brain computes the stimulus value signals, or how the underlying computations might be implemented. We investigated these questions using a human {fMRI} task in which individuals had to evaluate T-shirts that varied in their visual esthetic (e.g., color) and semantic (e.g., meaning of logo printed in T-shirt) components. We found that activity in the fusiform gyrus, an area associated with the processing of visual features, correlated with the value of the visual esthetic attributes, but not with the value of the semantic attributes. In contrast, activity in posterior superior temporal gyrus, an area associated with the processing of semantic meaning, exhibited the opposite pattern. Furthermore, both areas exhibited functional connectivity with an area of ventromedial prefrontal cortex that reflects the computation of overall stimulus values at the time of decision. The results provide supporting evidence for the hypothesis that some attribute values are computed in cortical areas specialized in the processing of such features, and that those attribute-specific values are then passed to the {vmPFC} to be integrated into an overall stimulus value signal to guide the decision.},

However, value correlates perfectly with salience when appetitive stimuli are investigated in isolation. Accordingly, considerable uncertainty has remained about the precise nature of the previously identified signals. In particular, recent evidence suggests that neurons in the primate parietal cortex signal salience instead of value. To investigate neural signatures of value and salience, here we apply multivariate (pattern-based) analyses to human functional {MRI} data acquired during a noninstrumental outcome-prediction task involving appetitive and aversive outcomes. Reaction time data indicated additive and independent effects of value and salience. Critically, we show that multivoxel ensemble activity in the posterior parietal cortex encodes predicted value and salience in superior and inferior compartments, respectively. These findings reinforce the earlier reports of parietal value signals and reconcile them with the recent salience report. Moreover, we find that multivoxel patterns in the orbitofrontal cortex correlate with value. Importantly, the patterns coding for the predicted value of appetitive and aversive outcomes are similar, indicating a common neural scale for appetite and aversive values in the orbitofrontal cortex. Thus orbitofrontal activity patterns satisfy a basic requirement for a neural value signal.},

Although this is a well-studied psychological phenomenon, little is known about the brain processes underlying automatic action tendencies in addiction. We examined 20 alcohol-dependent patients and 17 healthy controls with functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), while performing an implicit approach-avoidance task. Participants pushed and pulled pictorial cues of alcohol and soft-drink beverages, according to a content-irrelevant feature of the cue (landscape/portrait). The critical {fMRI} contrast regarding the alcohol-approach bias was defined as (approach alcohol{\textgreater}avoid alcohol){\textgreater}(approach soft drink{\textgreater}avoid soft drink). This was reversed for the avoid-alcohol contrast: (avoid alcohol{\textgreater}approach alcohol){\textgreater}(avoid soft drink{\textgreater}approach soft drink). In comparison with healthy controls, alcohol-dependent patients had stronger behavioral approach tendencies for alcohol cues than for soft-drink cues. In the approach, alcohol {fMRI} contrast patients showed larger blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex, regions involved in reward and motivational processing. In alcohol-dependent patients, alcohol-craving scores were positively correlated with activity in the amygdala for the approach-alcohol contrast. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was not activated in the avoid-alcohol contrast in patients vs controls. Our data suggest that brain regions that have a key role in reward and motivation are associated with the automatic alcohol-approach bias in alcohol-dependent patients.},

	abstract = {Objective:In alcohol-dependent patients, alcohol cues evoke increased activation in mesolimbic brain areas, such as the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala. Moreover, patients show an alcohol approach bias, a tendency to more quickly approach than avoid alcohol cues. Cognitive bias modification training, which aims to retrain approach biases, has been shown to reduce alcohol craving and relapse rates. The authors investigated effects of this training on cue reactivity in alcohol-dependent patients.Method:In a double-blind randomized design, 32 abstinent alcohol-dependent patients received either bias modification training or sham training. Both trainings consisted of six sessions of the joystick approach-avoidance task; the bias modification training entailed pushing away 90\% of alcohol cues and 10\% of soft drink cues, whereas this ratio was 50/50 in the sham training. Alcohol cue reactivity was measured with functional {MRI} before and after training.Results:Before training, alcohol cue-evoked activation was observed in the amygdala bilaterally, as well as in the right nucleus accumbens, although here it fell short of significance. Activation in the amygdala correlated with craving and arousal ratings of alcohol stimuli; correlations in the nucleus accumbens again fell short of significance. After training, the bias modification group showed greater reductions in cue-evoked activation in the amygdala bilaterally and in behavioral arousal ratings of alcohol pictures, compared with the sham training group. Decreases in right amygdala activity correlated with decreases in craving in the bias modification but not the sham training group.Conclusions:These findings provide evidence that cognitive bias modification affects alcohol cue-induced mesolimbic brain activity. Reductions in neural reactivity may be a key underlying mechanism of the therapeutic effectiveness of this training.},

For decades, economic models have assumed that when a person evaluates a choice option, different values contribute independently to the overall subjective value of the option. However, human choice behavior often violates this assumption, suggesting interactions between values. To investigate how qualitatively different advantages and disadvantages are integrated into an overall subjective value, we measured the brain activity of human subjects using {fMRI} while they were accepting or rejecting choice options that were combinations of monetary reward and physical pain. We compared different subjective value models on behavioral and neural data. These models all made similar predictions of choice behavior, suggesting that behavioral data alone are not sufficient to uncover the underlying integration mechanism. Strikingly, a direct model comparison on brain data decisively demonstrated that interactive value integration (where values interact and affect overall valuation) predicts neural activity in value-sensitive brain regions significantly better than the independent mechanism. Furthermore, effective connectivity analyses revealed that value-dependent changes in valuation are associated with modulations in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex–amygdala coupling. These results provide novel insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of human decision making involving the integration of different values.},

	abstract = {Social media allows users to explore self-identity and express emotions or thoughts. Research looking into the association between social media use ({SMU}) and mental health outcomes, such as anxiety or depressive symptoms, have produced mixed findings. These contradictions may best be addressed by examining different patterns of {SMU} as they relate to depressive symptomatology. We sought to assess the independent associations between active versus passive {SMU} and depressive symptoms. For this, we conducted an online survey of adults 18–49 of age. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System brief depression scale. We measured active and passive {SMU} with previously developed items. Factor analysis was used to explore the underlying factor structure. Then, we used ordered logistic regression to assess associations between both passive and active {SMU} and depressive symptoms while controlling for sociodemographic covariates. Complete data were received from 702 participants. Active and passive {SMU} items loaded on separate factors. In multivariable analyses that controlled for all covariates, each one-point increase in passive {SMU} was associated with a 33 percent increase in depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [{AOR}] = 1.33, 95 percent confidence interval [{CI}] = 1.17–1.51). However, in the same multivariable model, each one-point increase in active {SMU} was associated with a 15 percent decrease in depressive symptoms ({AOR} = 0.85, 95 percent {CI} = 0.75–0.96). To inform interventions, future research should determine directionality of these associations and investigate related factors.},

The sample comprised 1008 undergraduate students, aged between 17 and 32 years (M = 20.49, {SD} = 1.73; 60.5\% women). The participants completed a questionnaire comprising the Social Media Use Questionnaire, Social Media Usage Aims Scale, and Ten-Item Personality Inventory. Multiple linear and hierarchical regression analyses showed that social media use motives of (i) meeting new people and socializing, (ii) expressing or presenting a more popular self, and (iii) passing time and entertainment were associated with problematic social media use. Moreover, participants that preferred Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook reported higher scores of problematic social media use. Finally, being female, introverted, conscientious, agreeable, and neurotic were associated with {PSMU}. The findings offer empirical evidence for uses and gratifications theory because the findings demonstrated that (i) different personality traits predict different motives, (ii) different motives predict preference of different platforms, and (iii) different individual differences such as personality, preference of platform, and specific use motives predict {PSMU}.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Social media has become an integrated part of daily life, with an estimated 3 billion social media users worldwide. Adolescents and young adults are the most active users of social media. Research on social media has grown rapidly, with the potential association of social media use and mental health and well-being becoming a polarized and much-studied subject. The current body of knowledge on this theme is complex and difficult-to-follow. The current paper presents a scoping review of the published literature in the research field of social media use and its association with mental health and well-being among adolescents. Methods and analysis: First, relevant databases were searched for eligible studies with a vast range of relevant search terms for social media use and mental health and well-being over the past five years. Identified studies were screened thoroughly and included or excluded based on prior established criteria. Data from the included studies were extracted and summarized according to the previously published study protocol. Results: Among the 79 studies that met our inclusion criteria, the vast majority (94\%) were quantitative, with a cross-sectional design (57\%) being the most common study design. Several studies focused on different aspects of mental health, with depression (29\%) being the most studied aspect. Almost half of the included studies focused on use of non-specified social network sites (43\%). Of specified social media, Facebook (39\%) was the most studied social network site. The most used approach to measuring social media use was frequency and duration (56\%). Participants of both genders were included in most studies (92\%) but seldom examined as an explanatory variable. 77\% of the included studies had social media use as the independent variable. Conclusion: The findings from the current scoping review revealed that about ¾ of the included studies focused on social media and some aspect of pathology. Focus on the potential association between social media use and positive outcomes seems to be rarer in the current literature. Amongst the included studies, few separated between different forms of (inter)actions on social media, which are likely to be differentially associated with mental health and well-being outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background
Evidence suggests social media use is associated with mental health in young people but underlying processes are not well understood. This paper i) assesses whether social media use is associated with adolescents' depressive symptoms, and ii) investigates multiple potential explanatory pathways via online harassment, sleep, self-esteem and body image.
Methods
We used population based data from the {UK} Millennium Cohort Study on 10,904 14 year olds. Multivariate regression and path models were used to examine associations between social media use and depressive symptoms.
Findings
The magnitude of association between social media use and depressive symptoms was larger for girls than for boys. Compared with 1–3 h of daily use: 3 to {\textless}5 h 26\% increase in scores vs 21\%; ≥5 h 50\% vs 35\% for girls and boys respectively. Greater social media use related to online harassment, poor sleep, low self-esteem and poor body image; in turn these related to higher depressive symptom scores. Multiple potential intervening pathways were apparent, for example: greater hours social media use related to body weight dissatisfaction (≥5 h 31\% more likely to be dissatisfied), which in turn linked to depressive symptom scores directly (body dissatisfaction 15\% higher depressive symptom scores) and indirectly via self-esteem.
Interpretation
Our findings highlight the potential pitfalls of lengthy social media use for young people's mental health. Findings are highly relevant for the development of guidelines for the safe use of social media and calls on industry to more tightly regulate hours of social media use.

Thematic analysis suggested that adolescents perceived social media as a threat to mental wellbeing and three themes were identified: (1) it was believed to cause mood and anxiety disorders for some adolescents, (2) it was viewed as a platform for cyberbullying and (3) the use of social media itself was often framed as a kind of ‘addiction’. Future research should focus on targeting and utilising social media for promoting mental wellbeing among adolescents and educating youth to manage the possible deleterious effects.},

Exploratory principal component analysis further indicates that positive and negative emotions form orthogonal response components. In-depth interviews with a sub-sample of youth (n = 26), selected for maximum variation, reveal that affect experiences can be organized across four functional dimensions. Relational interactions contribute to both closeness and disconnection; self-expression facilitates affirmation alongside concern about others’ judgments; interest-driven exploration confers inspiration and distress; and browsing leads to entertainment and boredom, as well as admiration and envy. All interviewees describe positive and negative affect experiences across multiple dimensions. Analyses suggest the relationship between social technology usage and well-being—whether enhanced or degraded—is not confined to an “either/or” framework: the emotional see-saw of social media use is weighted by both positive and negative influences.},

Adolescents (N = 1205; 11–14 years; 51\% female; 51\% white) completed surveys at baseline and a six-month follow-up. There were three social media use subgroups at baseline: high overall social media use (8\%); high Instagram/Snapchat use (53\%); and low overall social media use (39\%). The high social media use subgroup predicted higher depressive symptoms, panic disorder symptoms, delinquent behaviors, family conflict, as well as lower family and friend support, than the High-Instagram/Snapchat and low social media use subgroups. The high Instagram/Snapchat use subgroup predicted higher delinquent behaviors and school avoidance than the low social media use subgroup, but also higher close friendship competence and friend support as compared to both the high social media use and low social media use subgroups. Social media use patterns appear to differentially predict psychosocial adjustment during early adolescence, with high social media use being the most problematic and patterns of high Instagram/Snapchat use and low social media use having distinct developmental tradeoffs.},

We sampled adolescents’ experiences six times per day for one week to quantify differences in their susceptibility to the effects of social media on their momentary affective well-being. Rigorous analyses of 2,155 real-time assessments showed that the association between social media use and affective well-being differs strongly across adolescents: While 44\% did not feel better or worse after passive social media use, 46\% felt better, and 10\% felt worse.

In the current study, participants viewed pictures of peers with feedback (positive, neutral or negative) to the participant's personal profile. Next, participants responded to the peer feedback by pressing a button, thereby producing a loud noise toward the peer, as an index of aggression. Behavioral analyses showed that negative feedback led to more aggression (longer noise blasts). Conjunction neuroimaging analyses revealed that both positive and negative feedback were associated with increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) and bilateral insula. In addition, more activation in the right dorsal lateral {PFC} ({dlPFC}) during negative feedback vs neutral feedback was associated with shorter noise blasts in response to negative social feedback, suggesting a potential role of {dlPFC} in aggression regulation, or top-down control over affective impulsive actions. This study demonstrates a role of the {dlPFC} in the regulation of aggressive social behavior.},

	abstract = {A growing body of literature is associating excessive and addictive use of digital media with physical, psychological, social and neurological adverse consequences. Research is focusing more on mobile devices use, and studies suggest that duration, content, after-dark-use, media type and the number of devices are key components determining screen time effects. Physical health effects: excessive screen time is associated with poor sleep and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, obesity, low {HDL} cholesterol, poor stress regulation (high sympathetic arousal and cortisol dysregulation), and Insulin Resistance. Other physical health consequences include impaired vision and reduced bone density. Psychological effects: internalizing and externalizing behavior is related to poor sleep. Depressive symptoms and suicidal are associated to screen time induced poor sleep, digital device night use, and mobile phone dependency. {ADHD}-related behavior was linked to sleep problems, overall screen time, and violent and fast-paced content which activates dopamine and the reward pathways. Early and prolonged exposure to violent content is also linked to risk for antisocial behavior and decreased prosocial behavior. Psychoneurological effects: addictive screen time use decreases social coping and involves craving behavior which resembles substance dependence behavior. Brain structural changes related to cognitive control and emotional regulation are associated with digital media addictive behavior. A case study of a treatment of an {ADHD} diagnosed 9-year-old boy suggests screen time induced {ADHD}-related behavior could be inaccurately diagnosed as {ADHD}. Screen time reduction is effective in decreasing {ADHD}-related behavior.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Components crucial for psychophysiological resilience are none-wandering mind (typical of {ADHD}-related behavior), good social coping and attachment, and good physical health. Excessive digital media use by children and adolescents appears as a major factor which may hamper the formation of sound psychophysiological resilience.},

	abstract = {Background: Problematic Instagram Use ({PIGU}), a Specific type of Internet Addiction, is prevalent among adolescents and young adults. In certain instances, Instagram acts as a platform for exhibiting photos of risk-taking behaviour that the subjects with {PIGU} upload to gain “Likes” as a surrogate for gaining peer acceptance and popularity. Aims: The primary objective was to evaluate whether addiction-specific cues compared with neutral cues i.e. ‘Negative Emotional Valence’ cues vs 'Positive Emotional Valence' cues, would elicit activation of the dopaminergic reward network (i.e. Precuneus, Nucleus Accumbens, Amygdala) and consecutive deactivation of the executive control network (i.e. medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({dlPFC}), in the {PIGU} subjects. Method: An {fMRI} cue-induced reactivity study was performed using 'Negative-Emotional-Valence', 'Positive-Emotional-Valence’, and 'Truly Neutral' cues, using Instagram themes. Thirty subjects were divided into {PIGU} and healthy control ({HC}) groups, based on a set of diagnostic criteria using behavioural tests, including the Modified Instagram Addiction Test ({IGAT}), to assess the severity of {PIGU}. In-scanner recordings of the subjects' responses to the images and regional activity of the neural addiction pathways were recorded. Results: 'Negative-Emotional-Valence' \&gt; 'Positive-Emotional-Valence’ cues elicited increased activations in the precuneus in the {PIGU} group. A negative and moderate correlation was observed between {PSC} at the right {mPFC} with the {IGAT} scores of the {PIGU} subjects when corrected for multiple comparisons [r = -0.777, (p \&lt; 0.004, two-tailed)]. Conclusion: Addiction-specific Instagram-themed cues identify the neurobiological underpinnings of Instagram addiction. Activations of the dopaminergic reward system and deactivation of the executive control network indicate converging neuropathological pathways between Instagram addiction and other types of addictions.},

	abstract = {Consumers often share product-related content (e.g., advertising), and highly shared advertising has a huge impact on consumer behavior. Despite its apparent effectiveness, prediction of whether such advertising will be highly shared is a poorly understood area of marketing. Advances in brain imaging techniques may allow researchers to forecast aggregate consumer behavior beyond subjective reports. Using neuroimaging techniques, previous research has established models showing that expectations of self-related outcomes (potential for self-enhancement) and the social impact of sharing (potential for social approval) contribute to the likelihood of users sharing non-commercial static content (i.e., text-based health news). However, whether this finding can be applied to forecasting the virality of dynamic commercial stimuli, which is more relevant to interactive marketing (i.e., video ads), remains unknown. Combining brain imaging techniques, cross-validation methods, and real-world data regarding sharing on social media, the present study investigated whether brain data can be used to forecast the viral marketing success of video ads. We used neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging: {fMRI}) to measure neural activity during three sets of theory-driven neural measures implicated in value, self, and social (mentalizing) processes while 40 participants viewed video ads that brands had posted on Facebook. Contrary to previous findings regarding value-related virality in non-commercial static content, our results indicate that social-related neural activity contributes significantly to forecasting the virality of dynamic marketing-related content. The model that included both social-related neural measures and subjective intentions to share forecasted viral marketing success better than the model that included only social-related neural measures. The model that included only subjective intention to share did not forecast viral marketing success. Overall, these findings provide a novel connection between neurophysiological measures and real-world dynamic commercial content. Contrary to previous neuroforecasting findings, social-related but not value-related neural measures can significantly improve our ability to predict market-level sharing of video ads.},

Afterward, {EEG} activity was acquired during a visual task showing exclusion and inclusion social images. Event Related Potentials ({ERP}) and {sLoreta} analyses were performed. In the {ERP} analyses the main effect of condition was found in temporo-parietal and frontal montages. {sLoreta} analyses showed a greater intensity of the left secondary somatosensory cortex ({BA}7) in inclusion compared with exclusion condition and a greater intensity of left temporal-parietal junction ({BA}41, {BA}42, {BA}43) and left prefrontal cortex ({BA}47) in exclusion versus inclusion condition. Moreover, the main finding of correlations analyses was that the {FOMOs} score was positively correlated with {ASQ}-need for approval and with right middle temporal gyrus ({BA}21) only during inclusion condition. Findings sustain that fear of missing out is associated to a greater sensitivity towards social inclusive experiences rather than social exclusion and with need of belong.},

This network was largely driven by the psychological comparison, with activity being higher for intelligence than height comparison in several areas in medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that their activation scales with the demand on person comparison. The person comparison network overlaps strikingly with that commonly described for classic theory of mind tasks.

During the experiment, participants were presented with unfamiliar faces of peers and were asked to predict whether they expected to be liked or disliked by the other person, followed by feedback indicating acceptance or rejection. Results showed that activation in the ventral {mPFC} and striatum to social feedback was context-dependent; there was increased activation when participants had positive expectations about social evaluation, and increased activation following social acceptance feedback. Age-related comparisons revealed a linear increase in activity with age in these brain regions for positive expectations of social evaluation. Similarly, a linear increase with age was found for activation in the striatum, ventral {mPFC}, {OFC}, and lateral {PFC} for rejection feedback. No age-related differences in neural activation were shown for social acceptance feedback.

To estimate the relationship between full names and race, we exploit the Florida voter registration data and the Wikipedia data. In particular, we model the relationship between the sequence of characters in a name, and race and ethnicity using Long Short Term Memory Networks. Our out of sample ({OOS}) precision and recall for the full name model estimated on the Florida Voter Registration data is .83 and .84 respectively. This compares to {OOS} precision and recall of .79 and .81 for the last name only model. Commensurate numbers for Wikipedia data are .73 and .73 for the full name model and .66 and .67 for the last name model. To illustrate the use of this method, we apply our method to the campaign finance data to estimate the share of donations made by people of various racial groups.},

	abstract = {Like many scientific disciplines, neuroscience has increasingly attempted to confront pervasive gender imbalances within the field. While much of the conversation has centered around publishing and conference participation, recent research in other fields has called attention to the prevalence of gender bias in citation practices. Because of the downstream effects that citations can have on visibility and career advancement, understanding and eliminating gender bias in citation practices is vital for addressing inequity in a scientific community. In this study, we sought to determine whether there is evidence of gender bias in the citation practices of neuroscientists. Using data from five top neuroscience journals, we find that reference lists tend to include more papers with men as first and last author than would be expected if gender were not a factor in referencing. Importantly, we show that this overcitation of men and undercitation of women is driven largely by the citation practices of men, and is increasing over time as the field becomes more diverse. We develop a co-authorship network to assess homophily in researchers' social networks, and we find that men tend to overcite men even when their social networks are representative. We discuss possible mechanisms and consider how individual researchers might address these findings in their own practices.},

Recent work in political science also reveals gender gaps in citations, with articles written by men citing work by other male scholars more often than work by female scholars. This study estimates the gender gap in citations across political science subfields and across methodological subfields within political science, sociology, and economics. The research design captures variance across research areas in terms of the underlying distribution of female scholars. We expect that subfields within political science and social science disciplines with more women will have smaller gender citation gaps, a reduction of the “Matthew effect” where men’s research is viewed as the most central and important in a field. However, gender citation gaps may persist if a “Matilda effect” occurs whereby women’s research is viewed as less important or their ideas are attributed to male scholars, even as a field becomes more diverse. Analysing all articles published from 2007–2016 in several journals, we find that female scholars are significantly more likely than mixed gender or male author teams to cite research by their female peers, but that these citation rates vary depending on the overall distribution of women in their field. More gender diverse subfields and disciplines produce smaller gender citation gaps, consistent with a reduction in the “Matthew effect”. However, we also observe undercitation of work by women, even in journals that publish mostly female authors. While improvements in gender diversity in academia increase the visibility and impact of scholarly work by women, implicit biases in citation practices in the social sciences persist.},

	abstract = {This article investigates the extent to which citation and publication patterns differ between men and women in the international relations ({IR}) literature. Using data from the Teaching, Research, and International Policy project on peer-reviewed publications between 1980 and 2006, we show that women are systematically cited less than men after controlling for a large number of variables including year of publication, venue of publication, substantive focus, theoretical perspective, methodology, tenure status, and institutional affiliation. These results are robust to a variety of modeling choices. We then turn to network analysis to investigate the extent to which the gender of an article's author affects that article's relative centrality in the network of citations between papers in our sample. Articles authored by women are systematically less central than articles authored by men, all else equal. This is likely because (1) women tend to cite themselves less than men, and (2) men (who make up a disproportionate share of {IR} scholars) tend to cite men more than women. This is the first study in political science to reveal significant gender differences in citation patterns and is especially meaningful because citation counts are increasingly used as a key measure of research's quality and impact.},

This study extends the literature on exposure and sharing decisions on {SNSs} by exploring how different attributes shape such decisions, how the two decision types differ, and by disentangling the role played by personal news recommendations and shared news stories on {SNSs}. As {SNSs} add a social dimension, exposure and sharing decisions are contingent not only upon the news story itself (news-story attributes) but also upon characteristics of the person who shares the story (recommender attributes). We designed a conjoint experiment to disentangle the effects of recommender and news-story attributes on the decision to recommend and read news and fielded it in a probability-based Norwegian online survey. The results suggest that committing to reading and sharing information are two similar yet distinct phenomena and that selective sharing is a stronger commitment than selective exposure. We also found evidence to suggest that selective sharing of news featuring a favored political party was contingent upon whether one also received information about the recommender attributes.},

the negative end of the spectrum but very small. Effects differ depending on the type of
use: whereas procrastination and passive use are related to more negative effects,
social and active use are related to more positive effects. Digital technology use has
stronger effects on short-term markers of hedonic well-being (eg, negative affect) than
long-term measures of eudaimonic well-being (eg, life satisfaction). Although
adolescents are more vulnerable, effects are comparable for both adolescents and adults.
It appears that both low and excessive use are related to decreased well-being, whereas
moderate use is related to increased well-being. The current research still has many
limitations: High-quality studies with large-scale samples, objective measures of
digital technology use, and experience sampling of well-being are

Differences in perspective may stem from the statistics used; I argue that comparing well-being across levels of digital-media use is more useful than the percentage of variance explained, as most studies on digital-media use do not measure other influences on well-being (e.g., genetics, trauma), and these other influences, unlike frequency of digital-media use, are rarely controllable. Nonusers are generally lower in well-being than light users of digital media, however, suggesting that limited use may be beneficial. Longitudinal and experimental studies suggest that at least some of the causation moves from digital-media use to lower well-being. Mechanisms may include the displacement of activities more beneficial to well-being (sleep, face-to-face social interaction), upward social comparison, and cyberbullying.},

Constructing autobiographical memories involves search, monitoring and self-referential processes that are associated with activity in separable prefrontal regions. The contributions of emotion and vividness have been linked to the amygdala and visual cortex respectively. Finally, there is evidence that recent and remote autobiographical memories might activate the hippocampus equally, which has implications for memory-consolidation theories. The rapid development of innovative methods for eliciting personal memories in the scanner provides the opportunity to delve into the functional neuroanatomy of our personal past.},

Findings from 94 independent tests showed that implementation intentions had a positive effect of medium‐to‐large magnitude (d = .65) on goal attainment. Implementation intentions were effective in promoting the initiation of goal striving, the shielding of ongoing goal pursuit from unwanted influences, disengagement from failing courses of action, and conservation of capability for future goal striving. There was also strong support for postulated component processes: Implementation intention formation both enhanced the accessibility of specified opportunities and automated respective goal‐directed responses. Several directions for future research are outlined.},

However, no research to date has experimentally manipulated conversational valence, thereby inhibiting conclusions about causal inferences. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the influence of conversational valence instructions on perceived conversational valence and subsequent binge drinking determinants. College students (N = 138) read either negative or positive conversational valence instructions. Subsequently, dyads engaged in a 5-min conversation about drinking, before self-reporting perceived conversational valence and binge drinking determinants (i.e., attitudes, norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions). Results revealed that valence instructions influenced binge drinking determinants via perceived conversational valence. Those instructed to talk negatively about binge drinking reported healthier binge drinking determinants than those instructed to talk positively. Furthermore, this effect on binge drinking determinants was mediated by perceived conversational valence. These findings demonstrate that conversational valence about health can be manipulated through simple instructions and confirm the idea that conversational valence is causally linked to binge drinking determinants. Thereby, these findings show the potential that interpersonal communication in general, and conversational valence instructions, in particular, have when integrated in health interventions.},

	abstract = {The growth of the internet has spawned new “attention markets,” in which people devote increasing amounts of time to consuming online content, but the neurobehavioral mechanisms that drive engagement in these markets have yet to be elucidated. We used functional {MRI} ({FMRI}) to examine whether individuals’ neural responses to videos could predict their choices to start and stop watching videos as well as whether group brain activity could forecast aggregate video view frequency and duration out of sample on the internet (i.e., on youtube.com). Brain activity during video onset predicted individual choice in several regions (i.e., increased activity in the nucleus accumbens [{NAcc}] and medial prefrontal cortex [{MPFC}] as well as decreased activity in the anterior insula [{AIns}]). Group activity during video onset in only a subset of these regions, however, forecasted both aggregate view frequency and duration (i.e., increased {NAcc} and decreased {AIns})—and did so above and beyond conventional measures. These findings extend neuroforecasting theory and tools by revealing that activity in brain regions implicated in anticipatory affect at the onset of video viewing (but not initial choice) can forecast time allocation out of sample in an internet attention market.},

This {fMRI} study assessed the extent to which early adolescents (n = 39, ages 12–14) conform to their parents’ and peers’ conflicting attitudes toward different types of behavior (unconstructive and constructive) and in response to different types of influence (negative and positive). Overall, adolescents exhibited low rates of conformity, sticking with their pre-existing attitudes 65 \% of the time. When they did conform, adolescents were more likely to conform to their peers’ attitudes towards constructive than unconstructive behaviors, exhibiting decreased activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and inferior frontal gyrus during peer conformity toward constructive over unconstructive behaviors. Adolescents were also more likely to conform when their parents and peers endorsed relatively more positive influence than negative influence, exhibiting increased activation in the temporoparietal junction when considering conforming to negative over positive influence. These results highlight early adolescents’ ability to stick with their own opinions when confronted with opposing attitudes and conform selectively based on the social context.},

We review evidence that people's motivations to share are guided in the brain by value-based decision making, with self-relevance and social-relevance as two key motivational inputs to the value computation. We then argue that persuaders who exhibit higher awareness of social considerations and increased recruitment of the brain's mentalizing system are more successful. We conclude by suggesting that approaches integrating social and neural networks can productively advance knowledge in this field.},

Two {fMRI} studies (N = 40 and 20), using previously broadcasted {TV} commercials, show that spatiotemporal neural similarity at temporal lobe and cerebellum predict out-of-sample preference and recall. A follow-up {fMRI} study (N = 28) with previously unseen movie-trailers replicated the predictive effect of neural similarity. Moreover, neural similarity provided unique information on out-of-sample preference above and beyond in-sample preference. Overall, the findings suggest that neural similarity at temporal lobe and cerebellum – traditionally associated with sensory integration and emotional processing – may reflect the level of engagement with video stimuli.},

The aim of this study was to develop and validate the Scale of Motives for Using Social Networking Sites ({SMU}-{SNS}), a measure to assess a wider range of motives for using Social Networking Sites than have previously been researched. A multi-method design with different samples of high-school and university students was used. First, to develop the pool of items, a literature review and a focus group study (n = 48, age range = 16–21) was conducted. Second, to reduce and refine the pool of items a pilot study (n = 168, age range = 14–24) was performed. Third, a validation study (n = 1102, age range = 13–25) was conducted to assess the validity and reliability of the {SMU}-{SNS}. Cross-validation using {EFA} and {CFA} resulted in a final version comprising 27 items distributed in nine factors (Dating, New Friendships, Academic Purposes, Social Connectedness, Following and Monitoring Others, Entertainment, seeking Social Recognition, Self-expression, and seeking Information). Internal consistency was excellent and evidence of measurement invariance across gender and age was largely achieved. The {SMU}-{SNS} scores significantly correlated with other relevant variables, including age, gender, certain personality traits, social support, loneliness, and life satisfaction. Overall, findings supported the {SMU}-{SNS} as a valid and reliable measure to assess youth’s motives for using Social Networking Sites. Psychometric and general implications are discussed.},

Thus, there may be deleterious effects of consuming large quantities of alcohol on neural development and associated cognition during this time. The purpose of this mini review is to highlight neuroimaging research that has specifically examined the effects of binge and heavy drinking on adolescent and young adult brain structure and function. Methods: We review cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of young binge and heavy drinkers that have examined brain structure (e.g., gray and white matter volume, cortical thickness, white matter microstructure) and investigated brain response using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}). Results: Binge and heavy-drinking adolescents and young adults have systematically thinner and lower volume in prefrontal cortex and cerebellar regions, and attenuated white matter development. They also show elevated brain activity in fronto-parietal regions during working memory, verbal learning, and inhibitory control tasks. In response to alcohol cues, relative to controls or light-drinking individuals, binge and heavy drinkers show increased neural response mainly in mesocorticolimbic regions, including the striatum, anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}), hippocampus, and amygdala. Mixed findings are present in risky decision-making tasks, which could be due to large variation in task design and analysis. Conclusions: These findings suggest altered neural structure and activity in binge and heavy-drinking youth may be related to the neurotoxic effects of consuming alcohol in large quantities during a highly plastic neurodevelopmental period, which could result in neural reorganization, and increased risk for developing an alcohol use disorder ({AUD}).},

	doi = {10.1016/j.addbeh.2015.03.001},
	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Heavy drinking during adolescence is associated with increased reactivity to alcohol related stimuli and to differential neural development. Alcohol cue reactivity has been widely studied among adults with alcohol use disorders, but little is known about the neural substrates of cue reactivity in adolescent drinkers. The current study aimed to identify changes in blood-oxygen level dependent ({BOLD}) signal during a cue reactivity task pre- and post-monitored abstinence from alcohol.
{METHOD}: Demographically matched adolescents (16.0-18.9 years, 54\% female) with histories of heavy episodic drinking ({HD}; n=22) and light or non-drinking control teens ({CON}; n=16) were recruited to participate in a month-long study. All participants completed a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI}) scan with an alcohol cue reactivity task and substance use assessments at baseline and after 28 days of monitored abstinence from alcohol and drugs (i.e., urine toxicology testing every 48-72 h). Repeated-measure analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) examined main effects of group, time, and group×time interactions on {BOLD} signal response in regions of interest defined by functional differences at baseline.
{RESULTS}: The {HD} group exhibited greater (p{\textless}.01) {BOLD} activation than {CON} to alcohol cues relative to neutral cues in all regions of interest ({ROIs}; bilateral striatum/globus pallidus, left anterior cingulate, bilateral cerebellum, and parahippocampal gyrus extending to the thalamus/substantia nigra) across time points. Group×time effects showed that {HD} exhibited greater {BOLD} activation to alcohol cues than {CON} at baseline in left anterior cingulate cortex and in the right cerebellar region, but these decreased to non-significance after one month of monitored abstinence.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In all {ROIs} examined, {HD} exhibited greater {BOLD} response than {CON} to alcohol relative to neutral beverage picture cues at baseline, indicating heightened cue reactivity to alcohol cues in heavy drinking adolescents prior to the onset of any alcohol use diagnosis. Across the majority of these brain regions, differences in {BOLD} response were no longer apparent following a month of abstinence, suggesting a decrease in alcohol cue reactivity among adolescent non-dependent heavy drinkers as a consequence of abstaining from alcohol. These results highlight the malleability of adolescent brain function despite no formal intervention targeting cue reactivity. Increased understanding of the neural underpinnings of cue reactivity could have implications for prevention and intervention strategies in adolescent heavy alcohol users.},

Two parallel studies were conducted, one advocating flossing (N = 196), the other urging students to limit their alcohol intake (N = 200). In both cases, a composite index of anger and negative cognitions fully mediated the effects of threat-to-freedom and trait reactance on attitude and intention. The data showed that, in fact, reactance can be operationalized as a composite of self-report indices of anger and negative cognitions.

	abstract = {This investigation tests a conceptualization of reactance as a two-step process. This conceptualization was recently tested with college students, but research testing this conceptualization among primarily adult samples does not currently exist. Psychological reactance theory ({PRT}) states that individuals exposed to a threat or elimination of a freedom will experience reactance and subsequently be motivated to restore the freedom. Specifically, it is hypothesized that individuals will perceive persuasive messages containing forceful language as a threat to their personal freedom, which will be followed by reactance, manifested in a latent variable composed of anger and negative cognitions. This hypothesis was tested within the context of persuasive messages aimed at encouraging members (N = 247) to participate in weight lifting or group exercise programs at a health and fitness center. Results support conceptualizing reactance as a 2-step process. In addition, results indicate that a primarily adult sample responds unfavorably to forceful persuasive messages advocating the aforementioned exercise activities. In finding support for conceptualizing reactance as a two-step process, we encourage health campaigners and {PRT} researchers to employ this measure to provide consistency to future {PRT} studies.},

	title = {Sharing in the Context of Tobacco and E-Cigarette Communication: Determinants, Consequences, and Contingent Effects},
	abstract = {Interpersonal communication has been shown to directly and indirectly influence various health behaviors, including smoking-related outcomes. However, the literature in this domain has mostly measured interpersonal communication as face-to-face conversations, and has treated such instances of communication as distinct from online forms of person-to-person communication. This dissertation is aimed at exploring sharing – an all-encompassing concept of person-to-person communication that covers both offline and online forms of communication – in the context of tobacco and e-cigarette communication, through three separate studies. Study 1 was a validation study that assessed the reliability and validity of a newly proposed sharing measure, providing a valid measure that could not only be used in the subsequent studies of this dissertation but also in future studies examining sharing in the tobacco and e-cigarette domain. In an effort to explore the nature of sharing, Study 2 examined the determinants of overall tobacco and e-cigarette sharing as well as sharing positive vs. negative tobacco and e-cigarette content. Findings showed that personal relevance and exposure to relevant information predicted sharing, and that personal relevance and normative perceptions interacted in their effects on the valence in which people shared. Study 3 was aimed at examining the consequences of sharing about tobacco and e-cigarettes. Specifically, it examined the direct effects of sharing on future intentions and behavior, as well as the contingent effects of sharing and pre-existing intentions on future behavior. Findings showed that sharing positive content predicted increased likelihood of intending to use and actually using tobacco and e-cigarettes. Furthermore, sharing consistently with intentions amplified the effect of those intentions on future behavior, while sharing inconsistently with intentions predicted reduced effects. Possible explanations for findings and potential areas for future research are discussed.},

Of particular interest are findings that point to the psychological value of studying particles—parts of speech that include pronouns, articles, prepositions, conjunctives, and auxiliary verbs. Particles, which serve as the glue that holds nouns and regular verbs together, can serve as markers of emotional state, social identity, and cognitive styles.},

In this paper we explore the factors which lead to successfully funding a crowdfunding project. We study a corpus of 45K crowdfunded projects, analyzing 9M phrases and 59 other variables commonly present on crowdfunding sites. The language used in the project has surprising predictive power accounting for 58.56\% of the variance around successful funding. A closer look at the phrases shows they exhibit general persuasion principles. For example, also receive two reflects the principle of Reciprocity and is one of the top predictors of successful funding. We conclude this paper by announcing the release of the predictive phrases along with the control variables as a public dataset, hoping that our work can enable new features on crowdfunding sites--tools to help both backers and project creators make the best use of their time and money.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates persuasion dynamics of animal adoption using text data from a large archive of online pet advertisements. In Study 1, 184,805 adoption profiles from Petfinder indicated how long a pet will remain online and unadopted. Consistent with evidence from related persuasion settings such as peer-to-peer lending, pets spent less time online if profile writers had an analytic thinking style and advertisements contained few peripheral processing cues such as social words. Study 2 (N = 676,004 adoption profiles) replicated Study 1 patterns and found that adopted pet profiles contained more markers of analytic thinking and fewer social words than unadopted pet profiles. In an experiment (Study 3, N = 987), participants read an adoption advertisement typical of adopted or unadopted pets. Participants self-reported that they would be more likely to adopt a pet and visit its shelter after reading a more analytic and less social adoption profile (indicators of adopted pets) than a less analytic and more social profile (indicators of unadopted pets). Finally, Study 4 (N = 3,245 Tweets) demonstrated that more analytic and less social word patterns relate to increased engagement online, such as likes and retweets. These data suggest pet adoption that begins online is a social and psychological process, enhanced by messages with markers of complex thinking and few humanizing references. Advances to persuasion theory are discussed, underscored by the implications for pet adoption and how language patterns in online advertisements can reflect influence at scale.},

It is a powerful tool for assessing the presence and strength of postulated causal mechanisms. Although mediation is used in certain areas of psychology, it is rarely applied in cognitive psychology and neuroscience. One reason for the scarcity of applications is that these areas of psychology commonly employ within-subjects designs, and mediation models for within-subjects data are considerably more complicated than for between-subjects data. Here, we draw attention to the importance and ubiquity of mediational hypotheses in within-subjects designs, and we present a general and flexible software package for conducting Bayesian within-subjects mediation analyses in the R programming environment. We use experimental data from cognitive psychology to illustrate the benefits of within-subject mediation for theory testing and comparison.},

The current study takes a generalizable approach to examining the prevalence of posting about alcohol on a popular social media platform, Twitter, as well as examining the predictors of a tweet’s virality. We content-analyzed more than 47.5 million tweets that were posted in March 2015 to explore the prevalence of alcohol-related references, and how alcohol-related references, tweet features (e.g., inclusion of hashtags, pictures, etc.), and user characteristics (e.g., number of followers) contribute to the tweet’s virality. Our findings showed that during March 2015, about two of every 100 tweets in the United States were alcohol-related; whereas the majority of those referenced intoxication. In addition to tweet features and user characteristics, the prevalence of alcohol-related references in a tweet positively predicted the number of likes it received, yet negatively predicted the number of retweets. Given prior evidence supporting the association between social media use and alcohol consumption, the prevalence of alcohol references in tweets and how that contributes to their virality offers insights into the widespread phenomenon of glorifying alcohol use and excessive drinking via social media, pointing to potential negative health consequences.},

An online survey was conducted on a microblogging platform to collect data for testing the proposed research model and hypotheses. The results confirm the positive effects of informational (i.e., information uniqueness), ambient (i.e., information crowding), and social (i.e., social interactivity) cues on individuals’ positive emotion, which subsequently promotes their urge to share information on microblogs. Moreover, the moderating effects of gender are identified. This study contributes to the understanding of instant information sharing from an impulsive behavior perspective.

This study examines user response to the posts published by 18 Facebook pages of Israeli news media in Russian language and investigates relationships between selective, interpretative and productive activities of a news user.We advocate that the usage of Emoji reactions on Facebook media pages is negatively correlated with commenting and sharing. The Love icon is used in the same way as the traditional Like. Posts evoking a Sad reaction are less likely to be commented or shared than posts arousing any other reaction.Second, we measure the congruence between different reactions expressed in a choice of one Emoji icon. The Love icon is used in the most monosemantic way. On the contrary, the post evoking a Wow reaction might be responded with any other Emoji reaction with a moderate degree of probability.

	abstract = {The proliferation of social media platforms and corresponding consumer adoption in recent years has precipitated a paradigm shift, significantly altering the ways customers engage with brands. Organisations recognise the social and network value of engagement within social media, and practitioners are endeavouring to build engagement through their social media content. However, theoretically based academic guidance concerning marketing practice and engagement in new media social networks is limited. This article provides a theoretical model to explicate the role of social media content in facilitating engagement behaviour within a social media context. Based on uses and gratifications theory, it provides a model for how an organisation can stimulate positively valenced engagement behaviour through social media and dissuade negatively valenced engagement behaviour in this forum. A typology of social media engagement behaviour is proposed and a series of hypotheses exploring the relationships between social media content and engagement behaviour are presented.},

Results from survey data collected over 3-waves during the 2012 {US} Presidential Election from an online panel of 403 {US} adult Internet users show that reading online news is positively related to factual political knowledge. Sharing online news, in contrast, is related to structural knowledge. We discuss these findings and their implications for future research investigating the role of online news.},

	abstract = {Social media users make decisions about what content to post and read. As posted content is often visible to others, users are likely to impose self-censorship when deciding what content to post. On the other hand, such a concern may not apply to reading social media content. As a result, the topics of content that a user posted and read can be diﬀerent and this has major implications to the applications that require personalization. To better determine and proﬁle social media users’ topic interests, we conduct a user survey in Twitter. In this survey, participants chose the topics they like to post (posting topics) and the topics they like to read (reading topics). We observe that users’ posting topics diﬀer from their reading topics signiﬁcantly. We ﬁnd that some topics such as “Religion”, “Business” and “Politics” attract much more users to read than to post. With the ground truth data obtained from the survey, we further explore the discovery of users’ posting and reading topics separately using features derived from their posted content, received content and social networks.},

The first message (high threat – low efficacy) described the negative impacts of climate change for China, but provided no information about what actions could be taken by citizens to reduce the threat. The second message (high threat – high efficacy) provided the same threat information, but also provided practical information on how to reduce the threat. Mediation analyses revealed that the high threat – high efficacy message elicited higher levels of perceived efficacy in viewers, which in turn predicted higher levels of danger control processing (intention to seek our more information and take action) and lower levels of fear control processing (message rejection and denial of threat). Moderation analyses revealed that the high efficacy messages were less effective for viewers with moderate to strong anthropocentric worldviews and very high ecocentric worldviews.},

Additionally, results showed evidence for problem-focused approach coping: Individuals' measured (Experiment 1) and manipulated group efficacy beliefs (Experiment 2) increased environmental action intentions. The results thus suggest that the dual pathway model can be successfully applied to a psychological analysis of emotion- and problem-focused approach coping with the climate crisis.

It increases people’s collective action tendencies, and is important for fostering environmental behavioral change beyond self-efficacy beliefs. The current study addresses two primary goals. First, we tested whether the difficulty of a task increased collective efficacy, and thereby environmental intentions. Second, we explored how collective and self-efficacy in concert predict such intentions. In a combined field-and-survey study, 165 voluntary participants took part in a plastic reduction challenge that was pretested as easy, moderate, or difficult. After being confronted with the task, participants completed an online questionnaire in which, among other variables, specific and general self-efficacy, collective efficacy, and pro-environmental intentions were measured—both general and plastic-reduction specific. Results revealed that (a) collective efficacy was significantly stronger when task difficulty was moderate rather than easy or difficult; and (b) that through specific collective and self-efficacy perceptions, sustainable intentions were gauged—even when controlling for attitudes and social norms. These findings suggest that collective efficacy beliefs are particularly relevant for attaining environmental goals that are neither too easy nor too difficult, and could thus be valuable for communication and policy strategies.},

	abstract = {Science communication aims to motivate action on climate change. We examined the usefulness of two related communication strategies: proximising climate change with news focussing on local impacts, and bridging psychological distance by raising the salience of people's global identity as part of humanity. We first examined the often implicitly assumed process underlying proximising, namely reducing the psychological socio-spatial distance of climate change, which in turn might make the issue more relevant for people, which in turn might promote behavioural engagement. Second, we argued that when people consider themselves as part of a global society, proximising may not be necessary as people perceive the relevance of distant impacts. We conducted an experiment with {UK} residents (N = 400) with two between subjects factors: proximity of communication on climate change (proximal or distant) and global identity salience (communicated or not). Communicating proximity (vs. distance) via a news text on climate change consequences for either the {UK} or Bangladesh reduced the psychological socio-spatial distance of climate change and indirectly predicted climate protective behaviour through lower psychological socio-spatial distance and higher relevance attribution. While these indirect relations were small, stronger relations might arise if people repeatedly receive local information. Participants for whom global identity was made salient (using a video showing a man dancing with people all over the world) exhibited no decreases in evaluating the relevance of the news text as their psychological socio-spatial distance of climate change increased (compared to those who viewed a control video). This indicates that global identity salience can bridge the psychological socio-spatial distance of climate change. We conclude that it is useful to report local consequences of climate change, or to communicate global connectedness if global consequences of climate change are described.},

This in turn leads to pro-environmental behavior in various behavioral domains (social engagement, private-sphere and workplace). Structural equation models were used to test the proposed model. Questionnaire data from Studies 1 and 2 suggest that the theory offers a good explanation of pro-environmental behavior. However, self-efficacy beliefs did not predict problem-focused coping or pro-environmental behavior. In a modified model, we hypothesized that with environmental problems as stressors, it would be collective (rather than individual) efficacy that determines coping attempts and pro-environmental behavior. Studies 3 and 4 found support for this modified model. Taken together the four studies lent support to our basic idea that appraisal processes activate problem-focused coping, which in turn leads to pro-environmental behavior.},

	abstract = {Avoiding dangerous climate change is one of the most urgent social risk issues we face today and understanding related public perceptions is critical to engaging the public with the major societal transformations required to combat climate change. Analyses of public perceptions have indicated that climate change is perceived as distant on a number of different dimensions. However, to date there has been no in-depth exploration of the psychological distance of climate change. This study uses a nationally representative British sample in order to systematically explore and characterize each of the four theorized dimensions of psychological distance--temporal, social, and geographical distance, and uncertainty--in relation to climate change. We examine how each of these different aspects of psychological distance relate to each other as well as to concerns about climate change and sustainable behavior intentions. Results indicate that climate change is both psychologically distant and proximal in relation to different dimensions. Lower psychological distance was generally associated with higher levels of concern, although perceived impacts on developing countries, as an indicator of social distance, was also significantly related to preparedness to act on climate change. Our findings clearly point to the utility of risk communication techniques designed to reduce psychological distance. However, highlighting the potentially very serious distant impacts of climate change may also be useful in promoting sustainable behavior, even among those already concerned.},

	abstract = {Many perceive climate change to be more relevant to distant places, future times, and other people than to the here and now and oneself. This perception has sparked interest in construal level theory ({CLT}) as a framework to understand how the public sees climate change, and how the subjective psychological distance at which people mentally represent objects affects their decisions and actions. Although at first {CLT} may appear to be the ideal lens through which to investigate psychological distance, I argue that applications of the theory in explaining and predicting climate change (in)action are limited. Researchers have sometimes used {CLT} in ways inconsistent with its original articulation; namely, (1) when claiming that psychological distant events are less personally relevant than close events; (2) when treating psychological distance as a stable individual belief; and (3) when speculating about what happens when such beliefs change. This article identifies places where research diverges from the scope of {CLT}, and suggests alternative perspectives that are theoretically better suited to investigating some important and common questions. As a constructive plea for theoretically rigorous research projects and practical work, this article outlines directions for future research that should help advance the field's understanding of psychological distance in the context of climate change and make interventions more effective.},

	abstract = {Current anthropogenic climate change is the result of greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere, which records the aggregation of billions of individual decisions. Here we consider a broad range of individual lifestyle choices and calculate their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries, based on 148 scenarios from 39 sources. We recommend four widely applicable high-impact (i.e. low emissions) actions with the potential to contribute to systemic change and substantially reduce annual personal emissions: having one fewer child (an average for developed countries of 58.6 tonnes {CO}2-equivalent ({tCO}2e) emission reductions per year), living car-free (2.4 {tCO}2e saved per year), avoiding airplane travel (1.6 {tCO}2e saved per roundtrip transatlantic flight) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 {tCO}2e saved per year). These actions have much greater potential to reduce emissions than commonly promoted strategies like comprehensive recycling (four times less effective than a plant-based diet) or changing household lightbulbs (eight times less). Though adolescents poised to establish lifelong patterns are an important target group for promoting high-impact actions, we find that ten high school science textbooks from Canada largely fail to mention these actions (they account for 4\% of their recommended actions), instead focusing on incremental changes with much smaller potential emissions reductions. Government resources on climate change from the {EU}, {USA}, Canada, and Australia also focus recommendations on lower-impact actions. We conclude that there are opportunities to improve existing educational and communication structures to promote the most effective emission-reduction strategies and close this mitigation gap.},

	abstract = {Climate change threatens agricultural productivity worldwide, resulting in higher food prices. Associated economic gains and losses differ not only by region but also between producers and consumers and are affected by market dynamics. On the basis of an impact modeling chain, starting with 19 different climate projections that drive plant biophysical process simulations and ending with agro-economic decisions, this analysis focuses on distributional effects of high-end climate change impacts across geographic regions and across economic agents. By estimating the changes in surpluses of consumers and producers, we find that climate change can have detrimental impacts on global agricultural welfare, especially after 2050, because losses in consumer surplus generally outweigh gains in producer surplus. Damage in agriculture may reach the annual loss of 0.3\% of future total gross domestic product at the end of the century globally, assuming further opening of trade in agricultural products, which typically leads to interregional production shifts to higher latitudes. Those estimated global losses could increase substantially if international trade is more restricted. If beneficial effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide fertilization can be realized in agricultural production, much of the damage could be avoided. Although trade policy reforms toward further liberalization help alleviate climate change impacts, additional compensation mechanisms for associated environmental and development concerns have to be considered.
Welfare losses from climate change in agriculture will mainly affect consumers, particularly in the low-latitude regions.

While some campaigns indeed go “viral,” their value to the brand is limited if they do not boost brand evaluation or increase purchase. Consequently, a key question is how to create valuable virality, or content that is not only shared but also beneficial to the brand. Share data from hundreds of real online ads, as well as controlled laboratory experiments, demonstrate that compared with informative appeals (which focus on product features), emotional appeals (which use drama, mood, music, and other emotion-eliciting strategies) are more likely to be shared. Informative appeals, in contrast, boost brand evaluations and purchase because the brand is an integral part of the ad content. By combining the benefits of both approaches, emotional brand-integral ads boost sharing while also bolstering brand-related outcomes. The authors’ framework sheds light on how companies can generate valuable virality and the mechanisms underlying these effects.},

In Study 1, 136 participants who, on average, met physical activity guidelines completed an implicit association task ({IAT}) to measure approach bias for words representing a physically active or inactive lifestyle. Approach bias scores were positive overall, indicative of an implicit motivation to approach physically active lifestyle cues. Study 2 explored whether pre-existing approach biases could be increased using approach training (pairing active words mostly with approach words) or decreased using avoid training (pairing active words mostly with avoidance words). The sample consisted of 73 participants who self-identified as being insufficiently active and, on average, reported levels of physical activity that were below recommended guidelines. Approach bias for physically active lifestyle cues was stronger for the approach group than the avoid group at post-training. However, training effects were moderated by the strength of the pre-existing approach bias; the group difference in approach bias was more apparent among participants with either a moderate or a strong pre-existing approach bias. The results are consistent with dual-process models which highlight the importance of non-conscious processes in health behaviour and intervention, and suggest that cognitive bias modification may be a useful pathway for promoting physical activity engagement.},

Automatic processes regulating exercise behaviors may partly explain this paradox. Yet, these processes have only been investigated with behavioral outcomes (i.e., based on reaction times). Here, using electroencephalography, we investigated the cortical activity underlying automatic approach and avoidance tendencies toward stimuli depicting physical activity and sedentary behaviors in 29 young adults who were physically active or physically inactive but with the intention of becoming physically active. Behavioral results showed faster reactions when approaching physical activity compared to sedentary behaviors and when avoiding sedentary behaviors compared to physical activity. These faster reactions were more pronounced in physically active individuals and were associated with changes during sensory integration (earlier onset latency and larger positive deflection of the stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potentials) but not during motor preparation (no effect on the response-locked lateralized readiness potentials). Faster reactions when avoiding sedentary behaviors compared to physical activity were also associated with higher conflict monitoring (larger early and late N1 event-related potentials) and higher inhibition (larger N2 event-related potentials), irrespective of the usual level of physical activity. These results suggest that additional cortical resources were required to counteract an attraction to sedentary behaviors. Data and Materials [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1169140].

A systematic literature review was performed to retrieve studies reporting both a measure of implicit attitudes and physical activity. For the meta-analysis, effect size (Pearson’s r) were extracted from eligible studies or retrieved from authors. A total of 26 independent studies, and 55 effect sizes, were eligible.

This association was not significantly moderated by study design or objective, participants’ age or other characteristics, or measures of implicit attitudes or physical activity.

With regard to the pivotal role of physical activity ({PA}) in health protection, understanding how individuals maintain regular {PA} despite ubiquitous opportunities to adopt behaviors minimizing energetic costs ({BMEC}) appears crucial. The purpose of the present research was to test whether {BMEC} primes act as temptations and activate {PA} goals in successful exercisers.
Design
Within and between-subjects experiments.
Methods
Students in sports science (Experiment 1; N = 46) and individuals with high value of {PA} goals and low versus high {PA} levels (Experiment 2; N = 28) performed a primed-lexical decision task.
Results
Experiment 1 revealed that {BMEC} primes facilitated the recognition of {PA}-related words, whereas {PA} primes did not facilitate the recognition of words related to {BMEC}. Experiment 2 showed that this facilitative effect was specific to individuals who were successful in reaching their {PA} goals.
Conclusions
{BMEC} act as temptations that automatically activate the representation of {PA} goals in individual who manage to maintain regular {PA}.},

According to one hypothesis, negative valence is more relevant for survival and is associated with a general slowdown of the processing of stimuli, due to a defense mechanism that freezes activity in the face of threat. According to a different hypothesis which does not posit a privileged role for the aversive system, valence, regardless of polarity, facilitates processing due to the relevance of both negative and positive stimuli for survival and for the attainment of goals. Here, we present evidence that emotional valence has an overall facilitatory role in the processing of verbal stimuli, providing support for the latter hypothesis. We found no asymmetry between negative and positive words and suggest that previous findings of such an asymmetry can be attributed to failure to control for a number of critical lexical variables and to a sampling bias.},

However, as the News Feed’s story selection mechanism starts to supplant traditional editorial story selection, we have no window into its story curation process that is parallel to our extensive knowledge of the news values that drive traditional editorial curation. The sensitive, trade-secret nature of the News Feed and its constant updates and modifications make a traditional, computer science-based examination of this algorithmic giant difficult, if not impossible. This study takes an alternative approach, using a content analysis of Facebook’s own patents, press releases, and Securities and Exchange Commission filings to identify a core set of algorithmic values that drive story selection on the Facebook News Feed. Informed by the principles of material culture analysis, it ranks these values to create a window into Facebook’s curation process, and compares and contrasts Facebook’s story selection values with traditional news values, examining the possible consequences of one set of values supplanting the other. The study finds a set of nine News Feed values that drive story selection: friend relationships, explicitly expressed user interests, prior user engagement, implicitly expressed user preferences, post age, platform priorities, page relationships, negatively expressed preferences, and content quality. It also finds evidence that friend relationships act as an overall influence on all other story selection values.},

Using a spatial model, an experiment is reported that examines the relationship between exposure, cognition, and affect. Subjects (N = 153) viewed a geometric figure either high or low in complexity within a 64-frame film clip, with each frame appearing for 28 msec. Because of exposure, the simpler stimulus and the term for affect are found to move almost directly toward each other in the multidimensional space, whereas no evidence for any cognitive change for this stimulus is found.

	abstract = {Behavioral studies have long shown that humans solve problems in two ways, one intuitive and fast (System 1, model-free), and the other reflective and slow (System 2, model-based). The neurobiological basis of dual process problem solving remains unknown due to challenges of separating activation in concurrent systems. We present a novel neuroeconomic task that predicts distinct subjective valuation and updating signals corresponding to these two systems. We found two concurrent value signals in human prefrontal cortex: a System 1 model-free reinforcement signal and a System 2 model-based Bayesian signal. We also found a System 1 updating signal in striatal areas and a System 2 updating signal in lateral prefrontal cortex. Further, signals in prefrontal cortex preceded choices that are optimal according to either updating principle, while signals in anterior cingulate cortex and globus pallidus preceded deviations from optimal choice for reinforcement learning. These deviations tended to occur when uncertainty regarding optimal values was highest, suggesting that disagreement between dual systems is mediated by uncertainty rather than conflict, confirming recent theoretical proposals.},

Mass media campaigns are widely used to expose high proportions of large populations to messages through routine uses of existing media, such as television, radio, and newspapers. Exposure to such messages is, therefore, generally passive. Such campaigns are frequently competing with factors, such as pervasive product marketing, powerful social norms, and behaviours driven by addiction or habit. In this Review we discuss the outcomes of mass media campaigns in the context of various health-risk behaviours (eg, use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, heart disease risk factors, sex-related behaviours, road safety, cancer screening and prevention, child survival, and organ or blood donation). We conclude that mass media campaigns can produce positive changes or prevent negative changes in health-related behaviours across large populations. We assess what contributes to these outcomes, such as concurrent availability of required services and products, availability of community-based programmes, and policies that support behaviour change. Finally, we propose areas for improvement, such as investment in longer better-funded campaigns to achieve adequate population exposure to media messages.},

Based on a large and unique data set using quantitative and qualitative meta-analyses, this research provides measures of the relative impact of each type of appeal, as well as the major differences among them, and identifies the moderating variables that lead to a better understanding of each. This investigation is based on persuasion research, which provides a framework for understanding the unique characteristics of these advertising appeals. It highlights empirical gaps in the academic literature and acts as a conceptual guide for our research hypotheses. Results reveal weaker effect sizes than those previously reported in the literature and show important differences among appeals that lead to a “hierarchy of appeals.” Specifically, emotional appeals, led by sex and humor, appear to be more effective than fear and rational appeals. The study finds new theoretical and empirical generalizations; some results are counterintuitive and differ from findings generated from single appeal studies. Findings are of theoretical and practical importance.},

	abstract = {Increased preference for immediate over delayed rewards and for risky over certain rewards has been associated with unhealthy behavioral choices. Motivated by evidence that enhanced cognitive control can shift choice behavior away from immediate and risky rewards, we tested whether training executive cognitive function could influence choice behavior and brain responses. In this randomized controlled trial, 128 young adults (71 male, 57 female) participated in 10 weeks of training with either a commercial web-based cognitive training program or web-based video games that do not specifically target executive function or adapt the level of difficulty throughout training. Pretraining and post-training, participants completed cognitive assessments and functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance of the following validated decision-making tasks: delay discounting (choices between smaller rewards now vs larger rewards in the future) and risk sensitivity (choices between larger riskier rewards vs smaller certain rewards). Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no evidence that cognitive training influences neural activity during decision-making; nor did we find effects of cognitive training on measures of delay discounting or risk sensitivity. Participants in the commercial training condition improved with practice on the specific tasks they performed during training, but participants in both conditions showed similar improvement on standardized cognitive measures over time. Moreover, the degree of improvement was comparable to that observed in individuals who were reassessed without any training whatsoever. Commercial adaptive cognitive training appears to have no benefits in healthy young adults above those of standard video games for measures of brain activity, choice behavior, or cognitive performance.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Engagement of neural regions and circuits important in executive cognitive function can bias behavioral choices away from immediate rewards. Activity in these regions may be enhanced through adaptive cognitive training. Commercial brain training programs claim to improve a broad range of mental processes; however, evidence for transfer beyond trained tasks is mixed. We undertook the first randomized controlled trial of the effects of commercial adaptive cognitive training (Lumosity) on neural activity and decision-making in young adults (N = 128) compared with an active control (playing on-line video games). We found no evidence for relative benefits of cognitive training with respect to changes in decision-making behavior or brain response, or for cognitive task performance beyond those specifically trained.},

The probe item evokes the search set on the basis of probe–memory item relatedness, just as a ringing tuning fork evokes sympathetic vibrations in other tuning forks. Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe–memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with data from 2 experiments conducted with 6 undergraduates. The theory is applied to 4 item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study–test, and continuous) and to speed–accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms. It is noted that neural network models can be interfaced to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may benefit from such a retrieval scheme.

This chapter discusses a wide variety of variables that proved instrumental in affecting the elaboration likelihood, and thus the route to persuasion. One of the basic postulates of the Elaboration Likelihood Model—that variables may affect persuasion by increasing or decreasing scrutiny of message arguments—has been highly useful in accounting for the effects of a seemingly diverse list of variables. The reviewers of the attitude change literature have been disappointed with the many conflicting effects observed, even for ostensibly simple variables. The Elaboration Likelihood Model ({ELM}) attempts to place these many conflicting results and theories under one conceptual umbrella by specifying the major processes underlying persuasion and indicating the way many of the traditionally studied variables and theories relate to these basic processes. The {ELM} may prove useful in providing a guiding set of postulates from which to interpret previous work and in suggesting new hypotheses to be explored in future research.},

Little is known, however, about the neural systems underlying such cost–benefit computations. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and choice modeling, we show that decision making based on cost–benefit comparison can be explained as a stochastic accumulation of cost–benefit difference. Model-driven functional {MRI} shows that ventromedial and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compare costs and benefits by computing the difference between neural signatures of anticipated benefits and costs from the ventral striatum and amygdala, respectively. Moreover, changes in blood oxygen level dependent ({BOLD}) signal in the bilateral middle intraparietal sulcus reflect the accumulation of the difference signal from ventromedial prefrontal cortex. In sum, we show that a neurophysiological mechanism previously established for perceptual decision making, that is, the difference-based accumulation of evidence, is fundamental also in value-based decisions. The brain, thus, weighs costs against benefits by combining neural benefit and cost signals into a single, difference-based neural representation of net value, which is accumulated over time until the individual decides to accept or reject an option.},

Mathematical psychology, and cognitive modeling more generally, has a rich history of formalizing and testing hypotheses about cognitive mechanisms within a mathematical and computational language, making exquisite predictions of how people perceive, learn, remember, and decide. Cognitive neuroscience aims to identify neural mechanisms associated with key aspects of cognition using techniques like neurophysiology, electrophysiology, and structural and functional brain imaging. These two come together in a powerful new approach called model-based cognitive neuroscience, which can both inform cognitive modeling and help to interpret neural measures. Cognitive models decompose complex behavior into representations and processes and these latent model states can be used to explain the modulation of brain states under different experimental conditions. Reciprocally, neural measures provide data that help constrain cognitive models and adjudicate between competing cognitive models that make similar predictions about behavior. As examples, brain measures are related to cognitive model parameters fitted to individual participant data, measures of brain dynamics are related to measures of model dynamics, model parameters are constrained by neural measures, model parameters or model states are used in statistical analyses of neural data, or neural and behavioral data are analyzed jointly within a hierarchical modeling framework.

	abstract = {This study investigated whether predictable motivational activation in the appetitive and aversive systems underlies the production and experience of discrete emotions (anger, sadness, joy, and fear) experienced while viewing televised public service announcements. This study used both self-reports and physiological measures to index motivational activation and emotional experience. In the joy condition, physiological data provided moderate support for the prediction that strong appetitive motivational activation underlies the experience of joy but did not support the concurrent prediction of aversive motivational inhibition. However, the self-report data provided good evidence for both. In the fear condition, the self-report data supported the prediction of strong aversive and inhibited appetitive activation. The physiological data provide strong support for a highly activated aversive system but no support for an inhibited appetitive system. In the sadness condition, the self-report and physiological data supported the prediction that sadness is a moderately activated aversive condition. In the anger condition, the physiological data supported the prediction that anger is a coactive state with both aversive and appetitive activation. This study suggests that research on cognition, emotion, and motivation can benefit by blending findings and insights from both discrete and dimensional approaches to the study of emotion.},

Results suggest that consumers recall familiar brands placed in the video game better than unfamiliar ones. Familiar brands also performed better in a brand recognition measure than unfamiliar brands. As no interaction effect of repetition was found, both familiar and unfamiliar brands will benefit equally of the effect of repetition. Managerial implications, limitations, and future research are also addressed.},

We estimated parameters from 268 curve estimates drawn from 81 articles and revealed that the mere exposure effect was characterized by a positive slope and negative quadratic effect consistent with an inverted-U shaped curve. In fact, such curves were associated with (a) all visual, but not auditory stimuli; (b) exposure durations shorter than 10 s and longer than 1 min; (c) both homogeneous and heterogeneous presentation types; and (d) ratings that were taken after all stimuli were presented. We conclude that existing models for the mere exposure effect do not adequately account for the findings, and we provide a framework to help guide future research.

Many observers also fear that negative campaigning has unintended but detrimental effects on the political system itself. An earlier meta-analytic assessment of the relevant literature found no reliable evidence for these claims, but since then the research literature has more than doubled in size and has greatly improved in quality. We reexamine this literature and find that the major conclusions from the earlier meta-analysis still hold. All told, the research literature does not bear out the idea that negative campaigning is an effective means of winning votes, even though it tends to be more memorable and stimulate knowledge about the campaign. Nor is there any reliable evidence that negative campaigning depresses voter turnout, though it does slightly lower feelings of political efficacy, trust in government, and possibly overall public mood.},

Thus, subjective reality matters more than objective reality. Furthermore, only the perceived valence of the participants’ own contributions—and not of their conversation partners—influences binge drinking intentions, indicating that self-persuasion is more influential than persuasion by others.

Methods: By employing a correlational design among Dutch undergraduate students (N = 133), this study measured alcohol consumption predictors and conversational valence and occurrence regarding three topics (personal alcohol-related experiences; alcohol-related experiences of others; and alcohol-related media messages). Results: Results showed that people talk more often and more positively about (personal) alcohol-related experiences than about alcohol-related media messages. In contrast to media messages, whether and how positively people talk about alcohol-related experiences was related to several alcohol consumption determinants. Conclusions: Health promotion attempts should elicit negative conversations about alcohol-related experiences, thereby resulting in more healthy alcohol consumption predictors.},

	abstract = {The use of social media for sharing political information and the status of news as an essential raw material for good citizenship are both generating increasing public concern. We add to the debates about misinformation, disinformation, and “fake news” using a new theoretical framework and a unique research design integrating survey data and analysis of observed news sharing behaviors on social media. Using a media-as-resources perspective, we theorize that there are elective affinities between tabloid news and misinformation and disinformation behaviors on social media. Integrating four data sets we constructed during the 2017 {UK} election campaign—individual-level data on news sharing (N = 1,525,748 tweets), website data (N = 17,989 web domains), news article data (N = 641 articles), and data from a custom survey of Twitter users (N = 1313 respondents)—we find that sharing tabloid news on social media is a significant predictor of democratically dysfunctional misinformation and disinformation behaviors. We explain the consequences of this finding for the civic culture of social media and the direction of future scholarship on fake news.},

Here, we propose that deviations from optimality arise from biological decision mechanisms that have evolved to maximize choice performance within intrinsic biophysical constraints. Sensory processing utilizes specific computations such as divisive normalization to maximize information coding in constrained neural circuits, and recent evidence suggests that analogous computations operate in decision-related brain areas. These adaptive computations implement a relative value code that may explain the characteristic context-dependent nature of behavioral violations of classical normative theory. Examining decision-making at the computational level thus provides a crucial link between the architecture of biological decision circuits and the form of empirical choice behavior.},

This enables modeling of problems that elude two prevailing economic decision theories: subjective expected utility theory and prospect theory. The network is unlike some that fit economic data by choosing optimal weights or coefficients within a predetermined mathematical framework. Rather, the framework itself is based on principles used elsewhere to model many other cognitive and behavioral data, in a manner approximating how humans perform behavioral functions. Different, interconnected modules within the network encode (a) attributes of objects among which choices are made, (b) object categories, (c) and goals of the decision maker. An example is utilized to simulate the actual consumer choice between old and new versions of Coca-Cola. Potential applications are also discussed to market decisions involving negotiations between participants, such as international petroleum traders.},

We suggest that seemingly counterintuitive decisions may arise as a natural consequence of the learning mechanisms deployed by humans. Here, using {fMRI} and a novel behavioural task, we show that, when suddenly switched to novel choice contexts, participants’ choices are incongruent with values learnt by standard learning algorithms. Instead, behaviour is compatible with the decisions of an agent learning how good an option is relative to an option with which it had previously been paired. Striatal activity exhibits the characteristics of a prediction error used to update such relative option values. Our data suggest that choices can be biased by a tendency to learn option values with reference to the available alternatives.},

However, for these models to predict choice preferences, more complex decision mechanisms have had to be introduced. We review here the complex decision mechanisms necessary to account for context effects found with multi-attribute, multi-alternative choices.

This review presents research from value-based, perceptual, and social decision-making domains, so far studied using isolated paradigms and their corresponding computational models. For example, in perceptual decision making, the sensory evidence accumulation rather than value computation becomes central to choice behavior. Furthermore, we identify cross-linkages between the perceptual and value-based domains to help us better understand generic processes pertaining to individual decision making. The purpose of this review is 2-fold. First, we identify the need for integrated study of different domains of decision making. Second, given that both our perception and valuation are influenced by the surrounding context, we suggest the integration of different types of information in decision making could be done by studying contextual influences in decision making. Future research needs to attempt toward a system-level understanding of various subprocesses involved in decision making.},

Here we outline a psychophysical task for value integration that can be used as a window on high-level, multiattribute decisions. Participants choose between alternative rapidly presented streams of numerical values. By controlling the temporal distribution of the values, we demonstrate that this process underlies many puzzling choice paradoxes, such as temporal, risk, and framing biases, as well as preference reversals. These phenomena can be explained by a simple mechanism based on the integration of values, weighted by their salience. The salience of a sampled value depends on its temporal order and momentary rank in the decision context, whereas the direction of the weighting is determined by the task framing. We show that many known choice anomalies may arise from the microstructure of the value integration process.},

We show that connections between regions of the visual, frontal, and cingulate cortices become stronger as learning progresses, with some of these changes being specific to the type of feedback received during learning.

Despite rich understanding of how individualism and collectivism influence social cognition at a behavioral level, little is known about how these cultural values modulate neural representations underlying social cognition. Using cross-cultural functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), we examined whether the cultural values of individualism and collectivism modulate neural activity within medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}) during processing of general and contextual self judgments. Here, we show that neural activity within the anterior rostral portion of the {MPFC} during processing of general and contextual self judgments positively predicts how individualistic or collectivistic a person is across cultures. These results reveal two kinds of neural representations of self (eg, a general self and a contextual self) within {MPFC} and demonstrate how cultural values of individualism and collectivism shape these neural representations.

The effect sizes for cultural products were larger than self-report effect sizes for this dimension (reported in Oyserman, Coon, \& Kemmelmeier, 2002).

Using a random effects multilevel regression model, the overall effect size (g = 0.67, p {\textless} .001) favored the effectiveness of culturally adapted interventions over other conditions (no intervention, other interventions). There was a medium effect size favoring the effectiveness of culturally adapted interventions over unadapted versions of the same intervention (g = .52). The overall effect size was moderated by whether the study involved treatment (g = .76) vs. prevention (g = .25, p = .03) and whether the study involved specific measures of mood or anxiety symptoms (g = .76) vs. general measures of psychopathology (g = .48, p = .02).

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor brain activity while dieters engaged in real decisions about food consumption. Activity in {vmPFC} was correlated with goal values regardless of the amount of self-control. It incorporated both taste and health in self-controllers but only taste in non–self-controllers. Activity in {DLPFC} increased when subjects exercised self-control and correlated with activity in {vmPFC}.
The neural circuitry underlying choice and self-control is revealed by modeling and brain imaging.

Furthermore, using objectively logged friendship network data, we examine how individual variability in brain reactivity to social exclusion relates to the density of participants’ friendship networks, an important aspect of social network structure. We find increased connectivity within a set of regions previously identified as a mentalizing system during exclusion relative to inclusion. These results are consistent across the regions of interest as well as a whole-brain analysis. Next, examining how social network characteristics are associated with task-based connectivity dynamics, we find that participants who showed greater changes in connectivity within the mentalizing system when socially excluded by peers had less dense friendship networks.

In recent years, investigators have attempted to integrate findings from functional neuroimaging studies in humans to generate models that might describe the contribution that this area makes to cognition. In all cases, however, such explanations are either too tied to a given task to be plausible or too general to be theoretically useful. Here, we use an account that is consistent with the connectional and cellular anatomy of the {aPFC} to explain the key features of existing models within a common theoretical framework.

Additional neuroimaging results indicate that this positive affect is elicited by the spontaneous retrieval of explicit memories associated with the celebrity endorser. Also, we demonstrate that neither the activation of implicit memories of earlier exposures nor an increase in attentional processing is essential for a celebrity advertisement to be effective.

We often change our decisions and judgments to conform with normative group behavior. However, the neural mechanisms of social conformity remain unclear. Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, that conformity is based on mechanisms that comply with principles of reinforcement learning. We found that individual judgments of facial attractiveness are adjusted in line with group opinion. Conflict with group opinion triggered a neuronal response in the rostral cingulate zone and the ventral striatum similar to the “prediction error” signal suggested by neuroscientific models of reinforcement learning. The amplitude of the conflict-related signal predicted subsequent conforming behavioral adjustments. Furthermore, the individual amplitude of the conflict-related signal in the ventral striatum correlated with differences in conforming behavior across subjects. These findings provide evidence that social group norms evoke conformity via learning mechanisms reflected in the activity of the rostral cingulate zone and ventral striatum.},

Neuroeconomic models propose that the value associated with each attribute is integrated in a global value for each option. However, evidence from patients with ventromedial frontal ({VMF}) damage argues against a very general role for this region in value integration, suggesting instead that it contributes critically to specific value inference or comparison processes. Here, we tested value-based decision-making between artificial multi-attribute objects in 12 men and women with focal damage to {VMF}, compared to a healthy control group (N=24) and a control group with frontal lobe damage sparing {VMF} (N=12). In a configural condition, overall object value was predicted by the conjunction of two attributes, while in an elemental condition, object value could be assessed by combining the independent values of individual attributes. Patients with {VMF} damage were impaired in making choices when value was uniquely predicted by the configuration of attributes, but intact when choosing based on elemental attribute-values. This is evidence that {VMF} is critical for inferring the value of whole objects in multi-attribute choice. These findings have implications for models of value-based choice, and add to emerging views of how this region may interact with medial temporal lobe systems involved in configural object processing and relational memory.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Moral judgment often requires making difficult tradeoffs (e.g., is it appropriate to torture to save the lives of innocents at risk?). Previous research suggests that both emotional appraisals and more deliberative utilitarian appraisals influence such judgments and that these appraisals often conflict. However, it is unclear how these different types of appraisals are represented in the brain, or how they are integrated into an overall moral judgment. We addressed these questions using an {fMRI} paradigm in which human subjects provide separate emotional and utilitarian appraisals for different potential actions, and then make difficult moral judgments constructed from combinations of these actions. We found that anterior cingulate, insula, and superior temporal gyrus correlated with emotional appraisals, whereas temporoparietal junction and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex correlated with utilitarian appraisals. Overall moral value judgments were represented in an anterior portion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Critically, the pattern of responses and functional interactions between these three sets of regions are consistent with a model in which emotional and utilitarian appraisals are computed independently and in parallel, and passed to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex where they are integrated into an overall moral value judgment.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Popular accounts of moral judgment often describe it as a battle for control between two systems, one intuitive and emotional, the other rational and utilitarian, engaged in winner-take-all inhibitory competition. Using a novel {fMRI} paradigm, we identified distinct neural signatures of emotional and utilitarian appraisals and used them to test different models of how they compete for the control of moral behavior. Importantly, we find little support for competitive inhibition accounts. Instead, moral judgments resembled the architecture of simple economic choices: distinct regions represented emotional and utilitarian appraisals independently and passed this information to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex for integration into an overall moral value signal.},

Here, we tested the hypothesis that our influence on others affects how much we are influenced by them. Participants first made a visual perceptual estimate and then shared their estimate with an alleged partner. Then, in alternating trials, the participant either revised their decisions or observed how the partner revised theirs. We systematically manipulated the partner’s susceptibility to influence from the participant. We show that participants reciprocated influence with their partner by gravitating toward the susceptible (but not insusceptible) partner’s opinion. In further experiments, we showed that reciprocity is both a dynamic process and is abolished when people believed that they interacted with a computer. Reciprocal social influence is a signaling medium for human-to-human communication that goes beyond aggregation of evidence for decision improvement., Humans give and receive social influence—e.g. advice—in many situations, but it is not known whether social influence is a reciprocal process, like trade. Here, the authors show that people are more likely to follow a partner's advice if that partner has previously complied with their advice.},

It is assumed that the associations between an attribute and an available alternative impact the attribute’s accessibility. The values of highly accessible attributes are more likely to be aggregated into preferences. Altering the choice task by adding new alternatives or by increasing the salience of preexisting alternatives can change the accessibility of the underlying attributes and subsequently bias choice. This mechanism is formalized by use of a preference accumulation decision process, embedded in a feed-forward neural network. The resulting model provides a unitary explanation for a large range of choice-set-dependent behaviors, including context effects, alignability effects, and less is more effects. The model also generates a gain–loss asymmetry relative to the reference point, without explicit loss aversion. This asymmetry accounts for all of the reference-dependent anomalies explained by loss aversion, as well as reference-dependent phenomena not captured by loss aversion.

	abstract = {Dopamine is implicated in a diverse range of cognitive functions including cognitive flexibility, task switching, signalling novel or unexpected stimuli as well as advance information. There is also longstanding line of thought that links dopamine with belief formation and, crucially, aberrant belief formation in psychosis. Integrating these strands of evidence would suggest that dopamine plays a central role in belief updating and more specifically in encoding of meaningful information content in observations. The precise nature of this relationship has remained unclear. To directly address this question we developed a paradigm that allowed us to decompose two distinct types of information content, information-theoretic surprise that reflects the unexpectedness of an observation, and epistemic value that induces shifts in beliefs or, more formally, Bayesian surprise. Using functional magnetic-resonance imaging in humans we show that dopamine-rich midbrain regions encode shifts in beliefs whereas surprise is encoded in prefrontal regions, including the pre-supplementary motor area and dorsal cingulate cortex. By linking putative dopaminergic activity to belief updating these data provide a link to false belief formation that characterises hyperdopaminergic states associated with idiopathic and drug induced psychosis.},

In this chapter, among a wide variety of forms of social influences, I will focus on social neuroscience studies investigating the following two forms of social influence: (1) observer effect (increased prosocial tendency in front of other people) and (2) social conformity (adjusting one's attitude or behavior to those of a group). I will first review studies investigating how one's concern for reputation formed by other people affects prosocial behavior and discuss how reputation processing is impaired in individuals with autism. Second, I will outline research on social conformity and especially highlight available evidence suggesting the link between social conformity and reward-based learning (reinforcement learning).},

	abstract = {Many of today's most widely used computing applications utilize social networking features and allow users to connect, follow each other, share content, and comment on others' posts. However, despite the widespread adoption of these features, there is little understanding of the consequences that social networking has on user retention, engagement, and online as well as offline behavior. Here, we study how social networks influence user behavior in a physical activity tracking application. We analyze 791 million online and offline actions of 6 million users over the course of 5 years, and show that social networking leads to a significant increase in users' online as well as offline activities. Specifically, we establish a causal effect of how social networks influence user behavior. We show that the creation of new social connections increases user online in-application activity by 30\%, user retention by 17\%, and user offline real-world physical activity by 7\% (about 400 steps per day). By exploiting a natural experiment we distinguish the effect of social influence of new social connections from the simultaneous increase in user's motivation to use the app and take more steps. We show that social influence accounts for 55\% of the observed changes in user behavior, while the remaining 45\% can be explained by the user's increased motivation to use the app. Further, we show that subsequent, individual edge formations in the social network lead to significant increases in daily steps. These effects diminish with each additional edge and vary based on edge attributes and user demographics. Finally, we utilize these insights to develop a model that accurately predicts which users will be most influenced by the creation of new social network connections.},

Our findings suggest that individuals who are highly motivated by self-presentation share news online more than others. Individuals also target different audiences, depending on their media environments. Specifically, {SNS} users are more cautious about their audiences’ connections with other users. The implications are that news sharing behaviors are a type of communication used for forming relationships and managing impressions beyond informational purposes, based on active individuals’ strategic considerations of their audiences’ characteristics.},

	abstract = {Numerous models explore how a wide variety of biological and social phenomena spread in social networks. However, these models implicitly assume that the spread of one phenomenon is not affected by the spread of another. Here, we develop a model of “dueling contagions”, with a particular illustration of a situation where one is biological (influenza) and the other is social (flu vaccination). We apply the model to unique time series data collected during the 2009 H1N1 epidemic that includes information about vaccination, flu, and face-to-face social networks. The results show that well-connected individuals are more likely to get vaccinated, as are people who are exposed to friends who get vaccinated or are exposed to friends who get the flu. Our dueling contagion model suggests that other epidemiological models may be dramatically underestimating the R0 of contagions. It also suggests that the rate of vaccination contagion may be even more important than the biological contagion in determining the course of the disease. These results suggest that real world and online platforms that make it easier to see when friends have been vaccinated (personalized vaccination campaigns) and when they get the flu (personalized flu warnings) could have a large impact on reducing the severity of epidemics. They also suggest possible benefits from understanding the coevolution of many kinds of dueling contagions.},

Ninety-two, four-person chains transmitted a story containing unambiguously positive and unambiguously negative story events, along with ambiguous story events that could be interpreted positively or negatively. Analysis using mixed-effects modeling revealed the preferential survival of unambiguously negative events over positive events, and the increasingly negative resolution of ambiguous events across successive transmission episodes. Contrary to predictions, elevated state anxiety did not enhance the social transmission of negatively-valenced information. We also found that the survival of unambiguously negative story events was positively correlated with the negative resolution of ambiguous story events, reflecting a general negativity-bias in the social transmission of information.},

	abstract = {We describe the effect of social media advertising content on customer engagement using data from Facebook. We content-code 106,316 Facebook messages across 782 companies, using a combination of Amazon Mechanical Turk and natural language processing algorithms. We use this data set to study the association of various kinds of social media marketing content with user engagement—defined as Likes, comments, shares, and click-throughs—with the messages. We find that inclusion of widely used content related to brand personality—like humor and emotion—is associated with higher levels of consumer engagement (Likes, comments, shares) with a message. We find that directly informative content—like mentions of price and deals—is associated with lower levels of engagement when included in messages in isolation, but higher engagement levels when provided in combination with brand personality–related attributes. Also, certain directly informative content, such as deals and promotions, drive consumers’ path to conversion (click-throughs). These results persist after incorporating corrections for the nonrandom targeting of Facebook’s {EdgeRank} (News Feed) algorithm and so reflect more closely user reaction to content than Facebook’s behavioral targeting. Our results suggest that there are benefits to content engineering that combines informative characteristics that help in obtaining immediate leads (via improved click-throughs) with brand personality–related content that helps in maintaining future reach and branding on the social media site (via improved engagement). These results inform content design strategies. Separately, the methodology we apply to content-code text is useful for future studies utilizing unstructured data such as advertising content or product reviews.The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2902.This paper was accepted by Chris Forman, information systems.},

Social influence is integral to the diffusion of private vehicles which are highly visible and fulfil practical as well as social functions. This paper provides the first meta-analysis of empirical studies which measure the strength of social influence on consumer vehicle choice. A systematic literature review identified 21 studies that examined three types of social influence: interpersonal communication; neighbourhood effect; and conformity with social norms. A random effects meta-analysis found a significant and small to moderate effect of social influence on vehicle choices (r=0.241, p{\textless}0.001). The overall effect size did not vary significantly between types of social influence nor between types of vehicle (conventional or alternative fuel). However, further analysis using meta-regression found that heterogeneity in social influence effect size across studies was explained by differences in countries' cultural receptiveness to normative influence. These findings have important implications for policy and modelling analysis of alternative fuel vehicle adoption, for which diffusion is both a socially and culturally-mediated process.},

Student subjects evaluated two resorts for a Spring Break vacation in Cancun using a 2 (valence: positive or negative) × 2 (unanimity: unanimous or nonunanimous) × 3 (price: same, slightly lower, much lower) experimental design. The results reveal that social influence had a strong effect on both resort evaluations and postdecision dissonance. Nonunanimous reviews reduced the prevailing valence of reviews, but increased dissonance. The lack of results for price suggests that price may not be the predominant influence on decisions, as previously thought.

However, the underlying psychological and neurocognitive mechanisms that influence message effectiveness and likelihood of sharing are not well understood, especially among adolescents. Based on research in adults, we hypothesized and preregistered that message-induced neural activation in regions associated with self-reflection, social processing, and positive valuation would be related to greater perceived ad effectiveness and intentions to share messages. We focused on brain activity in meta-analytically defined regions associated with these three processes as 40 adolescent nonsmokers viewed advertisements from “The Real Cost” antismoking campaign. Perceived message effectiveness was positively associated with brain activity in the hypothesized social processing regions and marginally associated with brain activity in self-relevance regions, but not associated with brain activity in valuation regions. By contrast, intentions to share the messages were not associated with neural response in these 3 systems. In contrast to previous neuroimaging studies with adult subjects, our findings highlight the role of social cognition in adolescent processing of persuasive messages. We discuss the possibility that the mental processes responsive to effective and shareworthy messages may reflect developmental processes pertinent to media effects.},

	abstract = {Background While antismoking media campaigns have demonstrated effectiveness, less is known about the country-level effects of increased media dosing. The 2012 {US} Tips From Former Smokers (Tips) campaign generated approximately 1.6 million quit attempts overall; however, the specific dose–response from the campaign was only assessed by self-report.
Objective Assess the impact of higher ad exposure during the 2013 Tips campaign on quit-related behaviours and intentions, campaign awareness, communication about campaign, and disease knowledge.
Methods A 3-month national media buy was supplemented within 67 (of 190) randomly selected local media markets. Higher-dose markets received media buys 3 times that of standard-dose markets. We compared outcomes of interest using data collected via web-based surveys from nationally representative, address-based probability samples of 5733 cigarette smokers and 2843 non-smokers.
Results In higher-dose markets, 87.2\% of smokers and 83.9\% of non-smokers recalled television campaign exposure versus 75.0\% of smokers and 73.9\% of non-smokers in standard-dose markets. Among smokers overall, the relative quit attempt rate was 11\% higher in higher-dose markets (38.8\% vs 34.9\%; p{\textless}0.04). The higher-dose increase was larger in African-Americans (50.9\% vs 31.8\%; p{\textless}0.01). Smokers in higher-dose markets without a mental health condition, with a chronic health condition, or with only some college education made quit attempts at a higher rate than those in standard-dose markets. Non-smokers in higher-dose markets were more likely to talk with family or friends about smoking dangers (43.1\% vs 35.7\%; p{\textless}0.01) and had greater knowledge of smoking-related diseases.
Conclusions The {US} 2013 Tips antismoking media campaign compared standard and higher doses by randomisation of local media markets. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of a higher dose for engaging non-smokers and further increasing quit attempts among smokers, especially African-Americans.},

We argue that in contrast to other studies investigating effects of political ads, our approach is more apt to capture the natural environment in which political ads are encountered during a presidential campaign. We focus on the intense inundation of political ads voters are confronted with in swing states in the weeks leading up to the presidential election, and argue that it is unclear a priori whether we should expect advertising to affect vote intention in that critical circumstance. We empirically validate this hypothesis using a trove of data from the 2012 campaign: daily polling in media markets around the country, detailed data on all registered voters in the country, all {TV} advertisements by market and exact airtime, and the entire Twitter corpus. We find that neither overall increases in advertising spending nor partisan imbalances in spending expanded the candidates’ electorate. In fact, total Designated Market Area ({DMA})-level spending significantly moderates a negative relationship between spending advantages and advantages in vote intention, suggesting a boomerang effect of additional spending late in the campaign. In closing, we discuss the ramifications of our findings for future research, and stress the importance of research tracking advertising effects.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Understanding potential trajectories in health and drivers of health is crucial to guiding long-term investments and policy implementation. Past work on forecasting has provided an incomplete landscape of future health scenarios, highlighting a need for a more robust modelling platform from which policy options and potential health trajectories can be assessed. This study provides a novel approach to modelling life expectancy, all-cause mortality and cause of death forecasts —and alternative future scenarios—for 250 causes of death from 2016 to 2040 in 195 countries and territories.
Methods
We modelled 250 causes and cause groups organised by the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study ({GBD}) hierarchical cause structure, using {GBD} 2016 estimates from 1990–2016, to generate predictions for 2017–40. Our modelling framework used data from the {GBD} 2016 study to systematically account for the relationships between risk factors and health outcomes for 79 independent drivers of health. We developed a three-component model of cause-specific mortality: a component due to changes in risk factors and select interventions; the underlying mortality rate for each cause that is a function of income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility rate under 25 years and time; and an autoregressive integrated moving average model for unexplained changes correlated with time. We assessed the performance by fitting models with data from 1990–2006 and using these to forecast for 2007–16. Our final model used for generating forecasts and alternative scenarios was fitted to data from 1990–2016. We used this model for 195 countries and territories to generate a reference scenario or forecast through 2040 for each measure by location. Additionally, we generated better health and worse health scenarios based on the 85th and 15th percentiles, respectively, of annualised rates of change across location-years for all the {GBD} risk factors, income per person, educational attainment, select intervention coverage, and total fertility rate under 25 years in the past. We used the model to generate all-cause age-sex specific mortality, life expectancy, and years of life lost ({YLLs}) for 250 causes. Scenarios for fertility were also generated and used in a cohort component model to generate population scenarios. For each reference forecast, better health, and worse health scenarios, we generated estimates of mortality and {YLLs} attributable to each risk factor in the future.
Findings
Globally, most independent drivers of health were forecast to improve by 2040, but 36 were forecast to worsen. As shown by the better health scenarios, greater progress might be possible, yet for some drivers such as high body-mass index ({BMI}), their toll will rise in the absence of intervention. We forecasted global life expectancy to increase by 4·4 years (95\% {UI} 2·2 to 6·4) for men and 4·4 years (2·1 to 6·4) for women by 2040, but based on better and worse health scenarios, trajectories could range from a gain of 7·8 years (5·9 to 9·8) to a non-significant loss of 0·4 years (–2·8 to 2·2) for men, and an increase of 7·2 years (5·3 to 9·1) to essentially no change (0·1 years [–2·7 to 2·5]) for women. In 2040, Japan, Singapore, Spain, and Switzerland had a forecasted life expectancy exceeding 85 years for both sexes, and 59 countries including China were projected to surpass a life expectancy of 80 years by 2040. At the same time, Central African Republic, Lesotho, Somalia, and Zimbabwe had projected life expectancies below 65 years in 2040, indicating global disparities in survival are likely to persist if current trends hold. Forecasted {YLLs} showed a rising toll from several non-communicable diseases ({NCDs}), partly driven by population growth and ageing. Differences between the reference forecast and alternative scenarios were most striking for {HIV}/{AIDS}, for which a potential increase of 120·2\% (95\% {UI} 67·2–190·3) in {YLLs} (nearly 118 million) was projected globally from 2016–40 under the worse health scenario. Compared with 2016, {NCDs} were forecast to account for a greater proportion of {YLLs} in all {GBD} regions by 2040 (67·3\% of {YLLs} [95\% {UI} 61·9–72·3] globally); nonetheless, in many lower-income countries, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional ({CMNN}) diseases still accounted for a large share of {YLLs} in 2040 (eg, 53·5\% of {YLLs} [95\% {UI} 48·3–58·5] in Sub-Saharan Africa). There were large gaps for many health risks between the reference forecast and better health scenario for attributable {YLLs}. In most countries, metabolic risks amenable to health care (eg, high blood pressure and high plasma fasting glucose) and risks best targeted by population-level or intersectoral interventions (eg, tobacco, high {BMI}, and ambient particulate matter pollution) had some of the largest differences between reference and better health scenarios. The main exception was sub-Saharan Africa, where many risks associated with poverty and lower levels of development (eg, unsafe water and sanitation, household air pollution, and child malnutrition) were projected to still account for substantive disparities between reference and better health scenarios in 2040.
Interpretation
With the present study, we provide a robust, flexible forecasting platform from which reference forecasts and alternative health scenarios can be explored in relation to a wide range of independent drivers of health. Our reference forecast points to overall improvements through 2040 in most countries, yet the range found across better and worse health scenarios renders a precarious vision of the future—a world with accelerating progress from technical innovation but with the potential for worsening health outcomes in the absence of deliberate policy action. For some causes of {YLLs}, large differences between the reference forecast and alternative scenarios reflect the opportunity to accelerate gains if countries move their trajectories toward better health scenarios—or alarming challenges if countries fall behind their reference forecasts. Generally, decision makers should plan for the likely continued shift toward {NCDs} and target resources toward the modifiable risks that drive substantial premature mortality. If such modifiable risks are prioritised today, there is opportunity to reduce avoidable mortality in the future. However, {CMNN} causes and related risks will remain the predominant health priority among lower-income countries. Based on our 2040 worse health scenario, there is a real risk of {HIV} mortality rebounding if countries lose momentum against the {HIV} epidemic, jeopardising decades of progress against the disease. Continued technical innovation and increased health spending, including development assistance for health targeted to the world's poorest people, are likely to remain vital components to charting a future where all populations can live full, healthy lives.

In this {fMRI} study, subjects were scanned either watching a novel 7-min animation depicting a complex narrative through the movement of geometric shapes, or listening to a narration of the animation's social story. Using an intersubject representational similarity analysis that compared interpretation similarity and neural similarity across subjects, we found that the more similar two people's interpretations of the abstract shapes animation were, the more similar were their neural responses in regions of the default mode network ({DMN}) and fronto-parietal network. Moreover, these shared responses were modality invariant: the shapes movie and the verbal interpretation of the movie elicited shared responses in linguistic areas and a subset of the {DMN} when subjects shared interpretations. Together, these results suggest a network of high-level regions that are not only sensitive to subtle individual differences in narrative interpretation during naturalistic conditions, but also resilient to large differences in the modality of the narrative.},

	abstract = {Successful human social interaction depends on our capacity to understand other people’s mental states and to anticipate how they will react to our actions. Despites its importance to the human condition, there are still quite a few debates about how we actually solve the problem of understanding other peoples’ actions, feelings and thoughts. Here we consider this problem from philosophical, psychological, and neuroscientific perspectives. In a critical review we show that attempts to draw parallels across these complementary levels of analysis are premature: The second-person perspective does not map directly to simulation theories, online social cognition or shared neural networks underlying action observation or empathy. Nor does the third-person perspective map onto theory-theory accounts of other agents mental states, offline social cognition or the neural networks that support Theory of Mind. We further propose that important qualities of social interaction emerge through the reciprocal interaction of two independent agents whose unpredictable behaviour requires a continual updating of models of their partner internal state. This analysis draws attention to the need for paradigms that allow two individuals to interact in a spontaneous and natural manner and to adapt their behaviour and cognitions in a response contingent fashion due to the unpredictability of their partners behaviour. Even if such paradigms were implemented, it is possible that the specific neural correlates supporting such reciprocal interaction would not reflect the processes unique to social interaction because much real social behaviour may reflect the use of basic cognitive and emotional process in a novel and unique manner. Given the role of social interaction in human evolution, ontogeny and every-day social life, a more theoretically and methodologically nuanced approach to the study of social interaction will help to shed new light on the dark matter of social neuroscience.},

	abstract = {Our reputation is important to us; we’ve experienced natural selection to care about our reputation. Recently, the neural processing of gains in reputation (positive social feedback concerning one’s character) has been shown to occur in the human ventral striatum. It is still unclear, however, how individual differences in the processing of gains in reputation may lead to individual differences in real-world behavior. For example, in the real-world, one way that people currently maintain their reputation is by using social media websites, like Facebook. Furthermore, Facebook use consists of a social comparison component, where users observe others’ behavior and can compare it to their own. Therefore, we hypothesized a relationship between the way the brain processes specifically self-relevant gains in reputation and one’s degree of Facebook use. We recorded functional neuroimaging data while participants received gains in reputation, observed the gains in reputation of another person, or received monetary reward. We demonstrate that across participants, when responding to gains in reputation for the self, relative to observing gains for others, reward-related activity in the left nucleus accumbens predicts Facebook use. However, nucleus accumbens activity in response to monetary reward did not predict Facebook use. Finally, a control step-wise regression analysis showed that Facebook use primarily explains our results in the nucleus accumbens. Overall, our results demonstrate how individual sensitivity of the nucleus accumbens to the receipt of self-relevant social information leads to differences in real-world behavior.},

To galvanize this interactive turn, we provide an operational definition of social interaction and distinguish the different explanatory roles – contextual, enabling and constitutive – it can play in social cognition. We show that interactive processes are more than a context for social cognition: they can complement and even replace individual mechanisms.

The nature of the decisions that a person makes will have an impact on his or her life. They will determine the kinds of relationships the person has with others; how others perceive him or her; and the degree of self knowledge and awareness that the person possesses. The study of self-disclosure has interested specialists from many disciplines, including personality and social psychologists, clinical and counseling psychologists, and communications researchers. Our book brings together the work of experts from these various disciplines with the hope that knowledge about work being done on self-disclosure in related disciplines will be increased. A strong emphasis in each of the chapters is theory development and the integration of ideas about self-disclosure. The book's chapters explore three major areas, including the interrelationship of self-disclosure and personality as well as the role of self-disclosure in the development, maintenance, and deterioration of personal relationships, and the con tribution of self-disclosure to psychotherapy, marital therapy, and counseling.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Exposure to alcohol use in media is associated with adolescent alcohol use. Adolescents frequently display alcohol references on Internet media, such as social networking web sites. The purpose of this study was to conduct a theoretically based content analysis of older adolescents' displayed alcohol references on a social networking web site.
Methods
We evaluated 400 randomly selected public {MySpace} profiles of self-reported 17- to 20-year-olds from zip codes, representing urban, suburban, and rural communities in one Washington county. Content was evaluated for alcohol references, suggesting: (1) explicit versus figurative alcohol use, (2) alcohol-related motivations, associations, and consequences, including references that met {CRAFFT} problem drinking criteria. We compared profiles from four target zip codes for prevalence and frequency of alcohol display.
Results
Of 400 profiles, 225 (56.3\%) contained 341 references to alcohol. Profile owners who displayed alcohol references were mostly male (54.2\%) and white (70.7\%). The most frequent reference category was explicit use (49.3\%); the most commonly displayed alcohol use motivation was peer pressure (4.7\%). Few references met {CRAFFT} problem drinking criteria (3.2\%). There were no differences in prevalence or frequency of alcohol display among the four sociodemographic communities.
Conclusions
Despite alcohol use being illegal and potentially stigmatizing in this population, explicit alcohol use is frequently referenced on adolescents' {MySpace} profiles across several sociodemographic communities. Motivations, associations, and consequences regarding alcohol use referenced on {MySpace} appear consistent with previous studies of adolescent alcohol use. These references may be a potent source of influence on adolescents, particularly given that they are created and displayed by peers.},

	abstract = {Aims During the development of drug addiction, initial hedonic effects decrease when substance use becomes habitual and ultimately compulsive. Animal research suggests that these changes are represented by a transition from prefrontal cortical control to subcortical striatal control and within the striatum from ventral to dorsal domains of the striatum, but only limited evidence exists in humans. In this study we address this hypothesis in the context of alcohol dependence. Design, setting and participants Non-abstinent heavy social drinkers (n = 21, 5.0 ± 1.5 drinks/day, 13 of them were alcohol-dependent according to {DSM}-{IV}) and light social drinkers (n = 10, 0.4 ± 0.4 drinks/day) were examined. Measurements We used a cue-reactivity functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) design during which pictures of alcoholic beverages and neutral control stimuli were presented. Findings In the dorsal striatum heavy drinkers showed significant higher activations compared to light drinkers, whereas light social drinkers showed higher cue-induced {fMRI} activations in the ventral striatum and in prefrontal areas compared to heavy social drinkers [region of interest analyses, P {\textless} 0.05 false discovery rate ({FDR})-corrected]. Correspondingly, ventral striatal activation in heavy drinkers correlated negatively with obsessive-compulsive craving, and furthermore we found a positive association between cue-induced activation in the dorsal striatum and obsessive-compulsive craving in all participants. Conclusions In line with our hypothesis we found higher cue-induced activation of the ventral striatum in social compared to heavy drinkers, and higher dorsal striatal activation in heavy drinkers. Increased prefrontal activation may indicate that social drinkers activate cortical control when viewing alcohol cues, which may prevent the development of heavy drinking or alcohol dependence. Our results suggest differentiating treatment research depending on whether alcohol use is hedonic or compulsive.},

	abstract = {Nicotine and alcohol may have common neurobiological mechanisms of reinforcement. Therefore, withholding one substance might result in compensatory increases in self-administration of the other. This laboratory study investigated the effects of brief tobacco deprivation on alcohol cue-elicited urges to drink, corresponding psychophysiological reactions, and alcohol consumption. Young adults (N=78) who were moderate to heavy smokers and drinkers were stratified and randomized to a 2×2 design. Participants were either deprived of tobacco for 5 h or not deprived and then exposed to in vivo alcohol or control beverage cues. Subsequently, participants engaged in a taste-rating task as an unobtrusive measure of alcohol consumption. Tobacco deprivation resulted in increased urge to smoke and decreased cardiovascular responses but did not increase alcohol urges or alcohol consumption. Results indicate that brief tobacco deprivation does not result in compensatory increases in alcohol consumption among young moderate to heavy drinkers.},

To date, less research has examined whether momentary decreases in alcohol craving are associated with reductions in attentional bias. One experimental manipulation that has been used to produce within-session decreases in alcohol craving is to extend the duration of laboratory-based alcohol-cue exposure protocols. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of both brief and extended alcohol-cue exposure on subjective craving and attentional bias among {UCSDs}. Eighty participants were randomized either to a group that received a short, in vivo, alcohol-cue-exposure period (short-exposure group [{SE}], 2 3-min blocks) or to a group that received a long-exposure period (long-exposure group [{LE}], 6 3-min blocks). Both groups completed a visual probe task before and after cue exposure to assess changes in attentional bias. Analyses revealed no group differences in mean craving or mean attentional bias before or after cue exposure. Further, exploratory analyses revealed no sex differences in our measures of craving or attentional bias. For Group {LE}, but not Group {SE}, within-session changes in craving positively predicted within-session changes in attentional bias. However, further analyses revealed that this relationship was significant only for women in the {LE} group. Implications for treatments that aim to reduce craving and/or attentional bias are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Participants (N=11) were scanned three times across their first year of college (summer, first semester, second semester), while completing a go/no-go task in which images of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages were the response cues.

Effective connections among {ROIs} implicated in cognitive control were greatest at the second assessment (when negative consequences of alcohol use increased), and effective connections among {ROIs} implicated in emotion processing were lower (and response times were slower) when participants were instructed to respond to alcohol cues compared to non-alcohol cues.

Thus, young people are exposed to and display pro-alcohol messages and images through online portrayals of drinking on personal pages as well as unregulated alcohol marketing on social media sites that may reach underage people. Such online displays of alcohol behavior have been correlated with offline alcohol behavior and risky drinking. Health behavior theories have been used to describe the influence of social media sites, including Social Learning Theory, the Media Practice Model, and a more recent conceptual approach called the Facebook Influence Model. Researchers are beginning to assess the potential of social media sites in identifying high-risk drinkers through online display patterns as well as delivering prevention messages and interventions. Future studies need to further expand existing observational work to better understand the role of social media in shaping alcohol-related behaviors and fully exploit the potential of these media for alcohol-related interventions.},

Many life-long health habits are established during adolescence, making it a window of opportunity for health promotion.

Although some health media campaigns that target adolescents are effective in changing health-relevant cognitions and behaviors, there is considerable room for improving these outcomes. Recent advancements combining neuroimaging tools and health persuasion have suggested key neural mechanisms underlying behavior change and retransmission of health-relevant ideas and norms in adults. This line of work highlights the integral role of the brain's value system in health persuasion and its importance for improving campaign design and effectiveness. Less is known about how these insights could be leveraged to inform adolescent health persuasion. In this article, we review what is known and unknown about the development of the brain's value system and its connections with cognitive control and social cognition systems across adolescence. Combining these insights, we propose that neuroimaging tools offer unique possibilities that could improve adolescent media health campaigns and promote adolescent well-being.},

	abstract = {Background
Ecological momentary assessment ({EMA}) assesses individuals’ current experiences, behaviors, and moods as they occur in real time and in their natural environment. {EMA} studies, particularly those of longer duration, are complex and require an infrastructure to support the data flow and monitoring of {EMA} completion.

Objective
Our objective is to provide a practical guide to developing and implementing an {EMA} study, with a focus on the methods and logistics of conducting such a study.

Methods
The {EMPOWER} study was a 12-month study that used {EMA} to examine the triggers of lapses and relapse following intentional weight loss. We report on several studies that informed the implementation of the {EMPOWER} study: (1) a series of pilot studies, (2) the {EMPOWER} study’s infrastructure, (3) training of study participants in use of smartphones and the {EMA} protocol and, (4) strategies used to enhance adherence to completing {EMA} surveys.

Results
The study enrolled 151 adults and had 87.4\% (132/151) retention rate at 12 months. Our learning experiences in the development of the infrastructure to support {EMA} assessments for the 12-month study spanned several topic areas. Included were the optimal frequency of {EMA} prompts to maximize data collection without overburdening participants; the timing and scheduling of {EMA} prompts; technological lessons to support a longitudinal study, such as proper communication between the Android smartphone, the Web server, and the database server; and use of a phone that provided access to the system’s functionality for {EMA} data collection to avoid loss of data and minimize the impact of loss of network connectivity. These were especially important in a 1-year study with participants who might travel. It also protected the data collection from any server-side failure. Regular monitoring of participants’ response to {EMA} prompts was critical, so we built in incentives to enhance completion of {EMA} surveys. During the first 6 months of the 12-month study interval, adherence to completing {EMA} surveys was high, with 88.3\% (66,978/75,888) completion of random assessments and around 90\% (23,411/25,929 and 23,343/26,010) completion of time-contingent assessments, despite the duration of {EMA} data collection and challenges with implementation.

Conclusions
This work informed us of the necessary preliminary steps to plan and prepare a longitudinal study using smartphone technology and the critical elements to ensure participant engagement in the potentially burdensome protocol, which spanned 12 months. While this was a technology-supported and -programmed study, it required close oversight to ensure all elements were functioning correctly, particularly once human participants became involved.},

Compliance with recording of substance use appears good but is harder to validate. Treatment applications of {EMA} are emerging. {EMA} captures substance use patterns not measured by questionnaires or retrospective data and holds promise for substance use research.

	abstract = {Objective: This study used a two-group randomized design to assess the validity of measuring self-reported alcohol consumption among college students using the Handheld Assisted Network Diary ({HAND}), a daily diary assessment administered using wireless mobile devices. Method: A convenience sample of college students was recruited at a large, public university in the southeastern United States and randomized into two groups. A randomly assigned group of 86 students completed the daily {HAND} assessment during the 30-day study and a Timeline Followback ({TLFB}) at 30-day follow-up. A randomly assigned group of 82 students completed the paper-and-pencil Daily Social Diary ({DSD}) over the same study period. Data from the daily {HAND} assessment were compared with the {TLFB} completed at follow-up by participants who completed the {HAND} using 95\% limits of agreement analysis. Furthermore, individual growth models were used to examine differences between the {HAND} and {DSD} by comparing the total drinks, drinking days, and drinks per drinking day captured by the two assessments over the study period. Results: Results suggest that the {HAND} captured similar levels of alcohol use compared with the {TLFB} completed at follow-up by the same participants. In addition, comparisons of the two study groups suggest that, controlling for baseline alcohol use and demographics, the {HAND} assessment captured similar levels of total drinks, drinking days, and drinks per drinking day as the paper-and-pencil {DSD}. Conclusions: The study findings support the validity of wireless mobile devices as a daily assessment of alcohol use among college students. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs 70: 771-775, 2009)},

	abstract = {Objective:In this study, we assess whether activation of the brain’s reward system in response to alcohol advertisements is associated with college drinking. Previous research has established a relationship between exposure to alcohol marketing and underage drinking. Within other appetitive domains, the relationship between cue exposure and behavioral enactment is known to rely on activation of the brain’s reward system. However, the relationship between neural activation to alcohol advertisements and alcohol consumption has not been studied in a nondisordered population.Method:In this cross-sectional study, 53 college students (32 women) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while viewing alcohol, food, and control (car and technology) advertisements. Afterward, they completed a survey about their alcohol consumption (including frequency of drinking, typical number of drinks consumed, and frequency of binge drinking) over the previous month.Results:In 43 participants (24 women) meeting inclusion criteria, viewing alcohol advertisements elicited activation in the left orbitofrontal cortex and bilateral ventral striatum—regions of the reward system that typically activate to other appetitive rewards and relate to consumption behaviors. Moreover, the level of self-reported drinking correlated with the magnitude of activation in the left orbitofrontal cortex.Conclusions:Results suggest that alcohol cues are processed within the reward system in a way that may motivate drinking behavior.},

This study examined the impact of alcohol and cannabis marketing on the reward circuit in alcohol and cannabis users while sober and intoxicated. It was predicted that alcohol and cannabis marketing would increase striatal activation when sober and that reward sensitivity would be less during alcohol and cannabis intoxication. Heavy alcohol (n = 20) and regular cannabis users (n = 21) participated in a mixed factorial study involving administration of alcohol and placebo in the alcohol group and cannabis and placebo in the cannabis group. Non-drug users (n = 20) served as between group reference. Brain activation after exposure to alcohol and cannabis marketing movies was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging and compared between groups while sober and compared with placebo while intoxicated. Implicit alcohol and cannabis cognitions were assessed by means of a single-category implicit association test. Alcohol and cannabis marketing significantly increased striatal {BOLD} activation across all groups while sober. Striatal activation however decreased during intoxication with alcohol and cannabis. Implicit associations with cannabis marketing cues were significantly more positive in alcohol and cannabis users as compared with non-drug using controls. Public advertising of alcohol or cannabis use elicits striatal activation in the brain's reward circuit. Reduction of marketing would reduce brain exposure to reward cues that motivate substance use. Conversely, elevated dopamine levels protect against the reinforcing potential of marketing.},

While simple decisions involve choosing a goal and pursuing it, humans evolved to survive in hostile dynamic environments where goal availability and value can change with time and previous actions, entangling goal decisions with action selection. Recent studies suggest the brain generates concurrent action-plans for competing goals, using online information to bias the competition until a single goal is pursued. This creates a challenging problem of integrating information across diverse types, including both the dynamic value of the goal and the costs of action. We model the computations underlying dynamic decision-making with disparate value types, using the probability of getting the highest pay-off with the least effort as a common currency that supports goal competition. This framework predicts many aspects of decision behavior that have eluded a common explanation.},

	abstract = {Although the idea of human beings being primarily and inextricably social has strong support in the psychological literature, an examination of how human beings actually choose to spend much of their time suggests a species more interested in solitude than social connection. In this chapter, we propose that a careful examination of seemingly nonsocial activities actually strongly supports a view of humans as primarily and inextricably social beings. We argue that the social self can be seen as strong, subtle, and sneaky. Specifically, because social motivations are so strong, they can be filled in unexpected ways that people may not even recognize. In other words, social motives sometimes work below the surface of consciousness in subtle and seemingly sneaky (i.e., unconscious and indirect) ways. For example, although we know we are being social when we call a friend on the phone or go to a party, our research suggests that we may also be socially motivated when we turn on the television, read a book, watch a football game, or go to a movie. We present evidence that supports a conception of a social self that propels us to actions that may not seem social to those around us, or even to ourselves, but that are actually fulfilling our very human and highly pervasive needs for social connection. We begin by discussing the seemingly nonsocial means people use to fulfill the need to belong. We then move on to reviewing evidence of ways in which people can be unaware of the strength of their social needs and of the social nature of their behavior. Finally, we conclude by discussing what this work suggests about human nature, modern behavior, and the social self.},

	shorttitle = {On the reproducibility of meta-analyses},
	abstract = {Background
Meta-analyses play an important role in cumulative science by combining information across multiple studies and attempting to provide effect size estimates corrected for publication bias. Research on the reproducibility of meta-analyses reveals that errors are common, and the percentage of effect size calculations that cannot be reproduced is much higher than is desirable. Furthermore, the flexibility in inclusion criteria when performing a meta-analysis, combined with the many conflicting conclusions drawn by meta-analyses of the same set of studies performed by different researchers, has led some people to doubt whether meta-analyses can provide objective conclusions.

Discussion
The present article highlights the need to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses to facilitate the identification of errors, allow researchers to examine the impact of subjective choices such as inclusion criteria, and update the meta-analysis after several years. Reproducibility can be improved by applying standardized reporting guidelines and sharing all meta-analytic data underlying the meta-analysis, including quotes from articles to specify how effect sizes were calculated. Pre-registration of the research protocol (which can be peer-reviewed using novel ‘registered report’ formats) can be used to distinguish a-priori analysis plans from data-driven choices, and reduce the amount of criticism after the results are known.

Summary
The recommendations put forward in this article aim to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses. In addition, they have the benefit of “future-proofing” meta-analyses by allowing the shared data to be re-analyzed as new theoretical viewpoints emerge or as novel statistical techniques are developed. Adoption of these practices will lead to increased credibility of meta-analytic conclusions, and facilitate cumulative scientific knowledge.},

The aim of this article is to provide a practical and nontechnical guide for psychological scientists that outlines the steps involved in planning and performing a meta-analysis of correlational datasets. I provide a supplementary R script to demonstrate each analytical step described in the paper, which is readily adaptable for researchers to use for their analyses. While the worked example is the analysis of correlational dataset, the general meta-analytic process described in this paper is applicable for all types of effect sizes.

The assumptions underlying this structure ignore the reality that natural behavior is rarely discrete, brain activity follows multiple time courses which do not necessarily conform to the trial structure, and the natural environment has statistical structure and dynamics that exhibit long-range temporal correlation. Modern advances in statistical modeling and analysis offer tools that make it feasible for experiments to move beyond the rigid independent and identically distributed trial structure. Here we review literature that serves as evidence for the feasibility and advantages of moving beyond trial-based paradigms in order to understand the neural basis of perception and cognition. Furthermore, we propose a synthesis of these efforts, integrating the characterization of natural stimulus properties with measurements of continuous neural activity and behavioral outputs within the framework of sensory-cognitive-motor-loops. Such a framework provides a basis for the study of natural statistics, naturalistic tasks, and/or slow fluctuations in brain activity, which should provide starting points for important generalizations of analytical tools in neuroscience and subsequent progress in understanding the neural basis of perception and cognition.},

Method: We reviewed the past 25 years of literature in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology, focusing on the relation and interplay of {fMRI} studies and studies utilizing the “lesion method” in human participants with focal brain damage. Results: Our review highlights the state of localist/connectionist research debates in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology circa 1992, and details how the introduction of {fMRI} into the field at that time catalyzed a new wave of efforts to map complex human behavior to specific brain regions. This, in turn, eventually evolved into many studies that focused on networks and connections between brain areas, culminating in recent years with large-scale investigations such as the Human Connectome Project. Conclusions: We argue that throughout the past 25 years, neuropsychology—and more precisely, the “lesion method” in humans—has continued to play a critical role in arbitrating conclusions and theories derived from inferred patterns of local brain activity or wide-spread connectivity from functional imaging approaches. We conclude by highlighting the future for neuropsychology in the context of an increasingly complex methodological armamentarium. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2018 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) is a powerful research tool to understand the neural underpinnings of human memory. However, as memory is known to be context-dependent, differences in contexts between naturalistic settings and the {MRI} scanner environment may potentially confound neuroimaging findings. Virtual reality ({VR}) provides a unique opportunity to mitigate this issue by allowing memories to be formed and/or retrieved within immersive, navigable, visuospatial contexts. This can enhance the ecological validity of task paradigms, while still ensuring that researchers maintain experimental control over critical aspects of the learning and testing experience. This mini-review surveys the growing body of {fMRI} studies that have incorporated {VR} to address critical questions about human memory. These studies have adopted a variety of approaches, including presenting research participants with {VR} experiences in the scanner, asking participants to retrieve information that they had previously acquired in a {VR} environment, or identifying neural correlates of behavioral metrics obtained through {VR}-based tasks performed outside the scanner. Although most such studies to date have focused on spatial or navigational memory, we also discuss the promise of {VR} in aiding other areas of memory research and facilitating research into clinical disorders.},

This brain-behavior relationship has been linked to areas of {MPFC} previously associated with self-related processing; however, the mechanism underlying this relationship is unclear. We explore two components of self-related processing – self-reflection and subjective valuation – and examine coherent activity between relevant networks of brain regions during exposure to health messages encouraging exercise and discouraging sedentary behaviors. We find that objectively logged reductions in sedentary behavior in the following month are linked to functional connectivity within brain regions associated with positive valuation, but not within regions associated with self-reflection on personality traits. Furthermore, functional connectivity between valuation regions contributes additional information compared to average brain activation within single brain regions. These data support an account in which {MPFC} integrates the value of messages to the self during persuasive health messaging and speak to broader questions of how humans make decisions about how to behave.},

Neural alterations that prevent stopping an inaccurate response, combined with a decreased ability of error monitoring, are considered to be prominent features of alcohol abuse. Moreover, (i) alterations of these processes have been reported in heavy social drinkers (i.e. young healthy individuals who do not yet exhibit a state of alcohol dependence); and (ii) through longitudinal studies, these alterations have been shown to underlie subsequent disinhibition that may lead to future alcohol use disorders. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study, using a contextual Go/No-Go task, we investigated whether different neural networks subtended correct inhibitions and monitoring mechanisms of failed inhibitory trials in light versus heavy social drinkers. We show that, although successful inhibition did not lead to significant changes, neural networks involved in error monitoring are different in light versus heavy drinkers. Thus, while light drinkers exhibited activations in their right inferior frontal, right middle cingulate and left superior temporal areas; heavy drinkers exhibited activations in their right cerebellum, left caudate nucleus, left superior occipital region, and left amygdala. These data are functionally interpreted as reflecting a “visually-driven emotional strategy” vs. an “executive-based” neural response to errors in heavy and light drinkers, respectively. Such a difference is interpreted as a key-factor that may subtend the transition from a controlled social heavy consumption to a state of clinical alcohol dependence.},

Fifty-eight adolescents (ages 13–17 years) completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task ({BART}) during an {fMRI} session and reported on their levels of risk-taking behavior. Results show that reduced medial {PFC} ({mPFC}) response following negative versus positive feedback is associated with fewer reductions in task-based risky decisions following negative feedback, as well as increased self-reported risk-taking behavior. These results suggest that reduced neural integration of negative feedback into during future decisions supports risky behavior, perhaps by discounting negative relative to positive feedback information when making subsequent risky decisions.},

Individual variation in {WM} has been associated with multiple behavioral and health features including demographic characteristics, cognitive and physical traits and lifestyle choices. In this context, we used sparse canonical correlation analyses ({sCCAs}) to determine the covariation between brain imaging metrics of {WM}-network activation and connectivity and nonimaging measures relating to sensorimotor processing, affective and nonaffective cognition, mental health and personality, physical health and lifestyle choices derived from 823 healthy participants derived from the Human Connectome Project. We conducted {sCCAs} at two levels: a global level, testing the overall association between the entire imaging and behavioral–health data sets; and a modular level, testing associations between subsets of the two data sets. The behavioral–health and neuroimaging data sets showed significant interdependency. Variables with positive correlation to the neuroimaging variate represented higher physical endurance and fluid intelligence as well as better function in multiple higher-order cognitive domains. Negatively correlated variables represented indicators of suboptimal cardiovascular and metabolic control and lifestyle choices such as alcohol and nicotine use. These results underscore the importance of accounting for behavioral–health factors in neuroimaging studies of {WM} and provide a neuroscience-informed framework for personalized and public health interventions to promote and maintain the integrity of the {WM} network.},

Technical advances and large-scale data sets have allowed for the development of models capable of predicting individual differences in traits and behavior using brain connectivity measures derived from neuroimaging data. Here, we present connectome-based predictive modeling ({CPM}), a data-driven protocol for developing predictive models of brain–behavior relationships from connectivity data using cross-validation. This protocol includes the following steps: (i) feature selection, (ii) feature summarization, (iii) model building, and (iv) assessment of prediction significance. We also include suggestions for visualizing the most predictive features (i.e., brain connections). The final result should be a generalizable model that takes brain connectivity data as input and generates predictions of behavioral measures in novel subjects, accounting for a considerable amount of the variance in these measures. It has been demonstrated that the {CPM} protocol performs as well as or better than many of the existing approaches in brain–behavior prediction. As {CPM} focuses on linear modeling and a purely data-driven approach, neuroscientists with limited or no experience in machine learning or optimization will find it easy to implement these protocols. Depending on the volume of data to be processed, the protocol can take 10–100 min for model building, 1–48 h for permutation testing, and 10–20 min for visualization of results.},

We review what is known about the role of the brain in driving pediatric food intake decisions, with emphasis on the importance of including objective measures of eating behavior to move the field forward. Because children's brains are undergoing developmental changes, pediatric neuroimaging presents challenges for both execution and analysis. Issues pertinent to pediatric samples that can impact scan success include movement, brain anatomy, and body size. We discuss ways in which these challenges can be overcome by conducting prescan training and designing experiments that include relevant indicators of overconsumption in youth (e.g., loss of control, eating speed). Studies that include children should be aware of developmental brain changes that may influence food intake decisions. Brain regions implicated in reward develop earlier than those implicated in cognitive control. For this reason, children are vulnerable to making poor dietary decisions. Future studies could use neurophysiological indicators of overconsumption to develop individualized interventions to prevent obesity.},

Next, we examined correlations between network connectivity and clinical metrics of treatment outcome. {PPI} analyses seeded on the orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}) showed significant increases in functional connectivity across the inferior frontal gyrus ({IFG}), precentral gyrus, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, supplementary motor area ({SMA}), superior frontal gyrus, pallidus, caudate, and parahippocampal gyrus. Further, greater functional connectivity between the {OFC} and anterior cingulate/medial frontal gyrus was associated with less behavior change (e.g., greater post-treatment cannabis problems). These data support the role of the {OFC} network as a mechanism of adolescent treatment response.},

	abstract = {Statistically underpowered studies can result in experimental failure even when all other experimental considerations have been addressed impeccably. In {fMRI} the combination of a large number of dependent variables, a relatively small number of observations (subjects), and a need to correct for multiple comparisons can decrease statistical power dramatically. This problem has been clearly addressed yet remains controversial—especially in regards to the expected effect sizes in {fMRI}, and especially for between-subjects effects such as group comparisons and brain-behavior correlations. We aimed to clarify the power problem by considering and contrasting two simulated scenarios of such possible brain-behavior correlations: weak diffuse effects and strong localized effects. Sampling from these scenarios shows that, particularly in the weak diffuse scenario, common sample sizes (n = 20–30) display extremely low statistical power, poorly represent the actual effects in the full sample, and show large variation on subsequent replications. Empirical data from the Human Connectome Project resembles the weak diffuse scenario much more than the localized strong scenario, which underscores the extent of the power problem for many studies. Possible solutions to the power problem include increasing the sample size, using less stringent thresholds, or focusing on a region-of-interest. However, these approaches are not always feasible and some have major drawbacks. The most prominent solutions that may help address the power problem include model-based (multivariate) prediction methods and meta-analyses with related synthesis-oriented approaches.},

Many cognitive models are not able to explain this intraindividual variability but focus on explaining interindividual differences captured in model parameters. In sequential sampling models of decision making, for instance, one single threshold parameter value is estimated for every person to quantify how much evidence must be accumulated for committing to a choice. However, this threshold may vary across trials even within subjects and experimental conditions. Neuroimaging tools such as functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) or electroencephalography ({EEG}) can reveal moment-to-moment fluctuations in the neural system that are likely to contribute to fluctuations in behavior. We propose that neural and behavioral variability could be linked to each other by assuming and estimating trial-by-trial variability in model parameters. To illustrate our proposal, we first highlight recent studies in model-based cognitive neuroscience that have gone beyond correlating model predictions with neuroimaging data. These studies made use of variance in behavior that remained unexplained by cognitive modeling but could be linked to specific {fMRI} or {EEG} signals. Second, we specify in a tutorial a novel and efficient approach, how to extract such variance and to apply it to neuroimaging data. Our proposal shows how the variability in behavior and the neural system can provide a fruitful source of theory development in cognitive neuroscience.},

These new methodological advances allow to deconstruct the rich spatiotemporal structure of functional components that dynamically assemble into resting-state networks long been observed using conventional measures of functional connectivity. Applications of these emerging methods demonstrate that changes in functional connectivity are indeed driven by complex reorganization of network interactions, and thus provide valuable observations to build better models of brain function and dysfunction.

However, it is unknown to what extent individual differences in neural representation of content and lived experience influence this brain-behavior relationship. We examined whether the strength of content-specific representations during persuasive messaging relates to later behavior change, and whether these relationships change as a function of individuals’ social network composition. In our study, smokers viewed anti-smoking messages while undergoing {fMRI} and we measured changes in their smoking behavior one month later. Using representational similarity analyses, we found that the degree to which message content (i.e. health, social, or valence information) was represented in a self-related processing {MPFC} region was associated with later smoking behavior, with increased representations of negatively valenced (risk) information corresponding to greater message-consistent behavior change. Furthermore, the relationship between representations and behavior change depended on social network composition: smokers who had proportionally fewer smokers in their network showed increases in smoking behavior when social or health content was strongly represented in {MPFC}, whereas message-consistent behavior (i.e., less smoking) was more likely for those with proportionally more smokers in their social network who represented social or health consequences more strongly. These results highlight the dynamic relationship between representations in {MPFC} and key outcomes such as health behavior change; a complete understanding of the role of {MPFC} in motivation and action should take into account individual differences in neural representation of stimulus attributes and social context variables such as social network composition.},

Because self-concept plays a fundamental role in individuals' social functioning and mental health, behavioral studies have examined cognitive processes of self-identity and self-knowledge extensively. Nevertheless, how different dimensions of the self-concept are organized in multi-voxel neural patterns remains elusive. Here, we address this issue by employing representational similarity analyses of behavioral/theoretical models of multidimensional self-representation and blood oxygen level dependent responses, recorded using functional {MRI}, to judgments of personality traits, physical attributes and social roles of oneself, a close (one's mother) other, and a distant (celebrity) other. The multivoxel patterns of neural activities in the medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}) and posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC}) distinguished representations of the self from both close and distant others, suggesting specific neural representation of the self-identity; and distinguished different dimensions of person knowledge of oneself, indicating dimension-sensitive neural representation of the self. Moreover, the pattern of {PCC} activity is more strongly coupled with discriminate dimensions of self-knowledge than self-identity. Our findings suggest that multivoxel neural patterns of the cortical midline structures distinguish not only self from others but also discriminate different dimensions of the self.},

Although brain-imaging studies consistently have shown involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula and striatum during risky decision-making, activation in a neural network formed by these regions has not been linked to structural connectivity. Therefore, in this study, white-matter connectivity was measured with diffusion-weighted imaging in 40 healthy research participants who performed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, a test of risky decision-making, during {fMRI}. Fractional anisotropy within a network that includes white-matter pathways connecting four regions (the prefrontal cortex, insula and midbrain to the striatum) was positively correlated with the number of risky choices and total amount earned on the task, and with the parametric modulation of activation in regions within the network to the level of risk during choice selection. Furthermore, analysis using a mixed model demonstrated how relationships of the parametric modulation of activation in each of the four aforementioned regions are related to risk probabilities, and how previous trial outcomes and task progression influence the choice to take risk. The present findings provide the first direct evidence that white-matter integrity is linked to function within previously identified components of a network that is activated during risky decision-making, and demonstrate that the integrity of white-matter tracts is critical in consolidating and processing signals between cortical and striatal circuits during the decision-making process.},

In seven experiments, across Studies 1 and 2, participants demonstrated a strong motivation to engage in shared experiences. At the same time, participants did not experience a commensurate increase in hedonic value or emotional amplification, suggesting that the social value of shared experiences does not derive from their hedonic value. In Study 3 we measured participants’ beliefs about the reasons people engage in shared experiences. Participants reported being motivated by the desire to forge a social connection; they did not report being motivated by the emotional benefits of a shared experience. Together, these findings suggest that the desire to share an experience may be distinct from the subjective experience of achieving that state.

These heightened reward responses predicted increases in subsequent attraction to well-liked targets.

In the task the mere association of a neutral cue and a speeded button response has been shown to induce a behavioral change lasting months. This paradigm includes several phases whereby after the training of individual items, behavior change is manifested through binary choices of items with similar initial values. Neuroimaging data have implicated the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({vmPFC}) during the choice phase of this task. However, it still remains unclear what are the underlying neural mechanisms during training. Here, we sought to determine whether the ventromedial frontal cortex ({VMF}) is critical for the non-reinforced preference change induced by {CAT}. For this purpose, eleven participants with focal lesions involving the {VMF} and 30 healthy age-matched controls performed the {CAT}. We found that at the individual level, a similar proportion of {VMF} and healthy participants showed a preference shift following {CAT}. The {VMF} group performed similarly to the healthy age-matched control group in the ranking and training phases. As a group the healthy age-matched controls exhibited a behavior change, but the {VMF} participants as a group did not. We did not find an association between individual lesion patterns and performance in the task. We conclude that a fully intact {VMF} is not critical to induce non-externally reinforced preference change and suggest potential mechanisms for this novel type of behavioral change.},

Multidisciplinary evidence demonstrates that people indeed track others’ social value, but the mechanisms through which such detection occurs remain unclear.

We mapped social networks in two freshman dormitories (n = 97), identifying how often individuals were nominated as socially valuable (i.e., sources of friendship, empathy, and support) by their peers. Next, we scanned a subset of dorm members (“perceivers”; n = 50) as they passively viewed photos of their dormmates (“targets”). Perceiver brain activity in regions associated with mentalizing and value computation differentiated between highly valued targets and other community members but did not differentiate between targets with middle versus low levels of social value. Cross-validation analysis revealed that brain activity from novel perceivers could be used to accurately predict whether targets viewed by those perceivers were high in social value or not. These results held even after controlling for perceivers’ own ratings of closeness to targets, and even though perceivers were not directed to focus on targets’ social value. Overall, these findings demonstrate that individuals spontaneously monitor people identified as sources of strong connection in the broader community.},

Although activity in both the nucleus accumbens ({NAcc}) and medial prefrontal cortex predicted individual choices to fund on a trial-to-trial basis in the neuroimaging sample, only {NAcc} activity generalized to forecast market funding outcomes weeks later on the Internet. Behavioral measures from the neuroimaging sample, however, did not forecast market funding outcomes. This pattern of associations was replicated in a second study. These findings demonstrate that a subset of the neural predictors of individual choice can generalize to forecast market-level crowdfunding outcomes-even better than choice itself.{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Forecasting aggregate behavior with individual neural data has proven elusive; even when successful, neural forecasts have not historically supplanted behavioral forecasts. In the current research, we find that neural responses can forecast market-level choice and outperform behavioral measures in a novel Internet crowdfunding context. Targeted as well as model-free analyses convergently indicated that nucleus accumbens activity can support aggregate forecasts. Beyond providing initial evidence for neuropsychological processes implicated in crowdfunding choices, these findings highlight the ability of neural features to forecast aggregate choice, which could inform applications relevant to business and policy.},

In this work, we hypothesized that a similar coding scheme is implemented by the human brain to process social signals and guide complex, value-based decisions.

Grounded in the science of coordination dynamics, previous research has revealed that interpersonal synchrony has numerous affiliative and pro-social consequences, such as enhanced rapport, cooperation, and social-cognitive functioning. The current study sought to explore the impact of intentional synchrony versus asynchrony on an individual’s self-esteem and their feelings of social connection with a partner. The results revealed that individuals felt better about themselves following a period of synchronous compared to asynchronous movement, while they also perceived a greater self-other overlap with their partner. These findings not only extend previous research on social connections following interpersonal synchrony, but also provide the first demonstration of an influence on self evaluations. Overall, it appears that moving in time with others may result in us feeling better about ourselves compared to moving to our own rhythm.},

Within the health neuroscience framework, the brain can be viewed as a predictor, mediator, moderator, or outcome in relation to health-related phenomena. This review explores examples of each of these, with specific reference to the primary prevention (i.e., prevention of initial onset) of chronic diseases. Within the topic of primary prevention, we touch on several cross-cutting themes (persuasive communications, delay discounting of rewards, and self-control), and place a special focus on obesity as a disorder influenced by both eating behavior and exercise habits.},

The aim was to examine reciprocal processes between exposure to a wide range of alcohol marketing types and adolescent drinking, controlled for non-alcohol branded media exposure. Design Prospective observational study (11–12- and 14–17-month intervals), using a three-wave autoregressive cross-lagged model. Setting School-based sample in 181 state-funded schools in Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland. Participants A total of 9075 eligible respondents participated in the survey (mean age 14 years, 49.5\% male. Measurements Adolescents reported their frequency of past-month drinking and binge drinking. Alcohol marketing exposure was measured by a latent variable with 13 items measuring exposure to online alcohol marketing, televised alcohol advertising, alcohol sport sponsorship, music event/festival sponsorship, ownership alcohol-branded promotional items, reception of free samples and exposure to price offers. Confounders were age, gender, education, country, internet use, exposure to non-alcohol sponsored football championships and television programmes without alcohol commercials. Findings The analyses showed one-directional long-term effects of alcohol marketing exposure on drinking (exposure T1 on drinking T2: β = 0.420 (0.058), P {\textless} 0.001, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) = 0.324–0.515; exposure T2 on drinking T3: β = 0.200 (0.044), P {\textless} 0.001, 95\% {CI} = 0.127–0.272; drinking T1 and drinking T2 on exposure: P {\textgreater} 0.05). Similar results were found in the binge drinking model (exposure T1 on binge T2: β = 0.409 (0.054), P {\textless} 0.001, 95\% {CI} = 0.320–0.499; exposure T2 on binge T3: β = 0.168 (0.050), P = 0.001, 95\% {CI} = 0.086–0.250; binge T1 and binge T2 on exposure: P {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusions There appears to be a one-way effect of alcohol marketing exposure on adolescents’ alcohol use over time, which cannot be explained by either previous drinking or exposure to non-alcohol-branded marketing.},

The study examines how evaluations of alcohol marketing status updates and display advertisements predict social media users’ intentions to consume alcohol, as a function of message virality and display ad type.

	abstract = {Purpose
This longitudinal study examined the influence of alcohol advertising and promotions on the initiation of alcohol use. A measure of receptivity to alcohol marketing was developed from research about tobacco marketing. Recall and recognition of alcohol brand names were also examined.
Methods
Data were obtained from in-class surveys of sixth, seventh, and eighth graders at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Participants who were classified as never drinkers at baseline (n = 1,080) comprised the analysis sample. Logistic regression models examined the association of advertising receptivity at baseline with any alcohol use and current drinking at follow-up, adjusting for multiple risk factors, including peer alcohol use, school performance, risk taking, and demographics.
Results
At baseline, 29\% of never drinkers either owned or wanted to use an alcohol branded promotional item (high receptivity), 12\% students named the brand of their favorite alcohol ad (moderate receptivity), and 59\% were not receptive to alcohol marketing. Approximately 29\% of adolescents reported any alcohol use at follow-up; 13\% reported drinking at least 1 or 2 days in the past month. Never drinkers who reported high receptivity to alcohol marketing at baseline were 77\% more likely to initiate drinking by follow-up than those were not receptive. Smaller increases in the odds of alcohol use at follow-up were associated with better recall and recognition of alcohol brand names at baseline.
Conclusions
Alcohol advertising and promotions are associated with the uptake of drinking. Prevention programs may reduce adolescents’ receptivity to alcohol marketing by limiting their exposure to alcohol ads and promotions and by increasing their skepticism about the sponsors’ marketing tactics.},

This paper presents a review of the literature showing that, while many econometric studies suggest little effect, more focused consumer studies, especially recent ones with sophisticated designs, do show clear links between advertising and behaviour. Furthermore, these effects have to be viewed in combination with the possible impact of other marketing activities such as price promotions, distribution, point of sale activity and new product development. Here, the evidence base is less well developed, but there are indications of effects. It must be acknowledged that categorical statements of cause and effect are always difficult in the social sciences; marketing is a complex phenomenon involving the active participation of consumers as well as marketers and more research is needed on its cumulative impact. Nonetheless, the literature presents an increasingly compelling picture that alcohol marketing is having an effect on young people's drinking.},

	abstract = {People tend to update beliefs about their future outcomes in a valence-dependent way: they are likely to incorporate good news and to neglect bad news. However, belief formation is a complex process which depends not only on motivational factors such as the desire for favorable conclusions, but also on multiple cognitive variables such as prior beliefs, knowledge about personal vulnerabilities and resources, and the size of the probabilities and estimation errors. Thus, we applied computational modeling in order to test for valence-induced biases in updating while formally controlling for relevant cognitive factors. We compared biased and unbiased Bayesian models of belief updating, and specified alternative models based on reinforcement learning. The experiment consisted of 80 trials with 80 different adverse future life events. In each trial, participants estimated the base rate of one of these events and estimated their own risk of experiencing the event before and after being confronted with the actual base rate. Belief updates corresponded to the difference between the two self-risk estimates. Valence-dependent updating was assessed by comparing trials with good news (better-than-expected base rates) with trials with bad news (worse-than-expected base rates). After receiving bad relative to good news, participants’ updates were smaller and deviated more strongly from rational Bayesian predictions, indicating a valence-induced bias. Model comparison revealed that the biased (i.e., optimistic) Bayesian model of belief updating better accounted for data than the unbiased (i.e., rational) Bayesian model, confirming that the valence of the new information influenced the amount of updating. Moreover, alternative computational modeling based on reinforcement learning demonstrated higher learning rates for good than for bad news, as well as a moderating role of personal knowledge. Finally, in this specific experimental context, the approach based on reinforcement learning was superior to the Bayesian approach. The computational validation of valence-dependent belief updating represents a novel support for a genuine optimism bias in human belief formation. Moreover, the precise control of relevant cognitive variables justifies the conclusion that the motivation to adopt the most favorable self-referential conclusions biases human judgments.},

	abstract = {Maintaining appropriate beliefs about variables needed for effective decision making can be difficult in a dynamic environment. One key issue is the amount of influence that unexpected outcomes should have on existing beliefs. In general, outcomes that are unexpected because of a fundamental change in the environment should carry more influence than outcomes that are unexpected because of persistent environmental stochasticity. Here we use a novel task to characterize how well human subjects follow these principles under a range of conditions. We show that the influence of an outcome depends on both the error made in predicting that outcome and the number of similar outcomes experienced previously. We also show that the exact nature of these tendencies varies considerably across subjects. Finally, we show that these patterns of behavior are consistent with a computationally simple reduction of an ideal-observer model. The model adjusts the influence of newly experienced outcomes according to ongoing estimates of uncertainty and the probability of a fundamental change in the process by which outcomes are generated. A prior that quantifies the expected frequency of such environmental changes accounts for individual variability, including a positive relationship between subjective certainty and the degree to which new information influences existing beliefs. The results suggest that the brain adaptively regulates the influence of decision outcomes on existing beliefs using straightforward updating rules that take into account both recent outcomes and prior expectations about higher-order environmental structure.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. By providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context.
{METHODS}: We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years ({DALYs}), and trends in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors-the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of deaths and {DALYs} that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific {DALY} rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a Socio-demographic Index ({SDI}).
{FINDINGS}: Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking each decreased by more than 25\%. Global exposure for several occupational risks, high body-mass index ({BMI}), and drug use increased by more than 25\% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57·8\% (95\% {CI} 56·6-58·8) of global deaths and 41·2\% (39·8-42·8) of {DALYs}. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to global {DALYs} among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure (211·8 million [192·7 million to 231·1 million] global {DALYs}), smoking (148·6 million [134·2 million to 163·1 million]), high fasting plasma glucose (143·1 million [125·1 million to 163·5 million]), high {BMI} (120·1 million [83·8 million to 158·4 million]), childhood undernutrition (113·3 million [103·9 million to 123·4 million]), ambient particulate matter (103·1 million [90·8 million to 115·1 million]), high total cholesterol (88·7 million [74·6 million to 105·7 million]), household air pollution (85·6 million [66·7 million to 106·1 million]), alcohol use (85·0 million [77·2 million to 93·0 million]), and diets high in sodium (83·0 million [49·3 million to 127·5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable {DALYs} declined for micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted {DALY} rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable {DALYs} from high {BMI}, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with {SDI}; low physical activity, high {BMI}, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with {SDI}. In 119 countries, metabolic risks, such as high {BMI} and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most attributable {DALYs} in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable {DALYs} in 109 countries; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa.
{INTERPRETATION}: Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be invariant to {SDI}. Increasing risks, including high {BMI}, high fasting plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable {DALYs}, even as exposure is declining. Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden.

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/uhbpz},
	abstract = {Social life requires us to treat each person according to their unique disposition: habitually enthusiastic friends need occasional grounding, whereas pessimistic colleagues require cheering-up. To tailor our behavior to specific individuals, we must represent their idiosyncrasies. Here we advance a hypothesis about how the brain achieves this goal: our representations of other people reflect the mental states we perceive those people to habitually experience. That is, rather than representing other people via traits, our brains represent people as the sums of their states. For example, if a perceiver observes that another person is frequently cheerful, sometimes thoughtful, and rarely grumpy, the perceiver’s representation of that person will be comprised of their representations of the mental states cheerfulness, thoughtfulness, and grumpiness, combined in a corresponding ratio. We tested this hypothesis by measuring whether neural representations of people could be accurately reconstructed by summing state representations. Separate participants underwent functional neuroimaging while considering famous individuals and individual mental states. Online participants rated how often each famous person experiences each state. Results supported the summed state hypothesis: frequency-weighted sums of state-specific brain activity patterns accurately reconstructed person-specific patterns. Moreover, the summed state account outperformed the established alternative – that people represent others using trait dimensions – in explaining interpersonal similarity, as measured through neural patterns, explicit ratings, binary choices, reaction times, and the semantics of biographical text. Together these findings demonstrate that the brain represents other people as the sums of the mental states they are perceived to experience.},

Research has not established which neuropsychological mechanisms support lending decisions, nor whether their influence extends to markets involving significant financial incentives. In two studies, we found that neural affective mechanisms influence the success of requests for microloans. In a large Internet database of microloan requests (N = 13,500), we found that positive affective features of photographs promoted the success of those requests. We then established that neural activity (i.e., in the nucleus accumbens) and self-reported positive arousal in a neuroimaging sample (N = 28) predicted the success of loan requests on the Internet, above and beyond the effects of the neuroimaging sample’s own choices (i.e., to lend or not). These findings suggest that elicitation of positive arousal can promote the success of loan requests, both in the laboratory and on the Internet. They also highlight affective neuroscience’s potential to probe neuropsychological mechanisms that drive microlending, enhance the effectiveness of loan requests, and forecast market-level behavior.},

	abstract = {Background: Since the early 2010s, the neuroimaging field has paid more attention to the issue of false positives. Several journals have issued guidelines regarding statistical thresholds. Three papers have reported the statistical analysis of the thresholds used in {fMRI} literature, but they were published at least three years ago and surveyed papers published during 2007–2012. This study revisited this topic to evaluate the changes in this field. Methods: The {PubMed} database was searched to identify the task-based (not resting-state) {fMRI} papers published in 2017 and record their sample sizes, inferential methods (e.g. voxelwise or clusterwise), theoretical methods (e.g. parametric or non-parametric), significance level, cluster-defining primary threshold ({CDT}), volume of analysis (whole brain or region of interest) and software used. Results: The majority (95.6\%) of the 388 analyzed articles reported statistics corrected for multiple comparisons. A large proportion (69.6\%) of the 388 articles reported main results by clusterwise inference. The analyzed articles mostly used software Statistical Parametric Mapping ({SPM}), Analysis of Functional {NeuroImages} ({AFNI}) or {FMRIB} Software Library ({FSL}) to conduct statistical analysis. There were 70.9\%, 37.6\% and 23.1\% of {SPM}, {AFNI} and {FSL} studies, respectively, that used a {CDT} of p ≤ 0.001. The statistical sample size across the articles ranged between 7 and 1299 with a median of 33. Sample size did not significantly correlate with the level of statistical threshold. Conclusions: There were still around 53\% (142/270) studies using clusterwise inference that chose a more liberal {CDT} than p = 0.001 (n = 121) or did not report their {CDT} (n = 21), down from around 61\% reported by Woo et al. (2014). For {FSL} studies, it seemed that the {CDT} practice had no improvement since the survey by Woo et al. (2014). A few studies chose unconventional {CDT} such as p = 0.0125 or 0.004. Such practice might create an impression that the threshold alterations were attempted to show “desired” clusters. The median sample size used in the analyzed articles was similar to those reported in previous surveys. In conclusion, there seemed to be no change in the statistical practice compared to the early 2010s.},

	abstract = {{FMRI} studies of response inhibition consistently reveal frontal lobe activation. Localization within the frontal cortex, however, varies across studies and appears dependent on the nature of the task. Activation likelihood estimate ({ALE}) meta-analysis is a powerful quantitative method of establishing concurrence of activation across functional neuroimaging studies. For this study, {ALE} was used to investigate concurrent neural correlates of successfully inhibited No-go stimuli across studies of healthy adults performing a Go/No-go task, a paradigm frequently used to measure response inhibition. Due to the potential overlap of neural circuits for response selection and response inhibition, the analysis included only event-related studies contrasting No-go activation with baseline, which allowed for inclusion of all regions that may be critical to visually guided motor response inhibition, including those involved in response selection. These Go/No-go studies were then divided into two groups: “simple” Go/No-go tasks in which the No-go stimulus was always the same, and “complex” Go/No-go tasks, in which the No-go stimulus changed depending on context, requiring frequent updating of stimulus–response associations in working memory. The simple and complex tasks demonstrated distinct patterns of concurrence, with right dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal circuits recruited under conditions of increased working memory demand. Common to both simple and complex Go/No-go tasks was concurrence in the pre-{SMA} and the left fusiform gyrus. As the pre-{SMA} has also been shown to be involved in response selection, the results support the notion that the pre-{SMA} is critical for selection of appropriate behavior, whether selecting to execute an appropriate response or selecting to inhibit an inappropriate response.},

	abstract = {Many psychological theories suggest a link between self-regulation and identity, but, until now, a mechanistic account that suggests ways to improve self-regulation has not been put forth. The identity-value model ({IVM}) connects the idea from social psychology that aspects of identity such as core values and group affiliations hold positive subjective value to the process-focused account from decision making and behavioral economics that self-regulation is driven by a dynamic value integration across a range of choice attributes. Together, these ideas imply that goal-directed behaviors that are identity relevant are more likely to be enacted because they have greater subjective value than identity-irrelevant behaviors. A central hypothesis, therefore, is that interventions that increase the degree to which a target behavior is perceived as self-relevant will improve self-regulation. In addition, identity-based changes in self-regulation are expected to be mediated by changes in subjective value and its underlying neural systems. In this article we define the key constructs relevant to the {IVM}, explicate the model and delineate its boundary conditions, and describe how it fits with related theories. We also review disparate results in the research literature that might share identity-related value as a common underlying mechanism of action. We close by discussing questions about the model, the answers to which could advance the study of self-regulation.},

	abstract = {This paper applies the limited capacity model of motivated mediated messages ({LC}4MP) to the problem of creating effective messages about cancer. A general description of the model is presented and then applied specifically to the task of creating effective cancer communication messages by asking the following questions about cancer communication: (a) What is the goal of the message? (b) Who is in the target market? (c) What medium will carry the message? and (d) What is the motivational and personal relevance of the main information in the message for the majority of people in the target market? The paper concludes that cancer is a motivationally relevant topic that will elicit aversive activation. Target markets for various types of cancer-related messages (e.g., smokers or people of a certain age) will process mediated messages in predictably different ways making certain design decisions better for certain target markets. Both structural and content elements of messages interact with the limited capacity information processing system to impact resource allocation, which in turn determines how well messages are encoded, stored, and retrieved at a decision point. Individual differences in peoples’ motivational activation influence both their tendencies to engage in risky behaviors that increase the probabilities of getting cancer and their processing of health-related messages. Future research from this perspective should be done to optimize cancer messages for specific target audiences using specific media.},

Method: We examined responses of students in the Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study ({CAS}) 1997, 1999 and 2001 data sets at 37 colleges that employed social norms marketing programs and at 61 that did not. Information about the students' drinking behavior and their familiarity with social norms marketing messages at their schools was analyzed, as were college administrators' reports about the implementation of social norms marketing campaigns. Schools were grouped on the basis of student reports of exposure to programmatic materials. Trend analyses were conducted on seven standard measures of alcohol consumption, including annual and 30-day use, frequency, usual quantity and volume consumed, heavy episodic use, and drunkenness. Results: Almost half of the {CAS} colleges sampled adopted social norms programs. Those that did were more likely to have large enrollments, not to be religiously affiliated and to have high rates of alcohol use. No decreases were noted in any of the seven measures of alcohol use at schools with social norms programs, even when student exposure and length of program existence were considered. Increases in measures of monthly alcohol use and total volume consumed, however, were observed at schools employing social norms programs. Conclusions: This study does not provide evidence to support the effectiveness of social norms marketing programs, as currently utilized, in reducing alcohol use among college students.},

	abstract = {Background
Electronic word-of-mouth on social network sites has been used successfully in marketing. In social marketing, electronic word-of-mouth about products as health behaviors has the potential to be more effective and reach more young adults than health education through traditional mass media. However, little is known about what motivates people to actively initiate electronic word-of-mouth about health behaviors on their personal pages or profiles on social network sites, thus potentially reaching all their contacts on those sites.

Objective
This study filled the gap by applying a marketing theoretical model to explore the factors associated with electronic word-of-mouth on social network sites about leisure-time physical activity.

Methods
A Web survey link was sent to undergraduate students at one of the Midwestern universities and 439 of them completed the survey.

Results
The average age of the 439 participants was 19 years ({SD}=1 year, range: 18-24). Results suggested that emotional engagement with leisure-time physical activity (ie, affective involvement in leisure-time physical activity) predicted providing relevant opinions or information on social network sites. Social network site users who perceived stronger ties with all their contacts were more likely to provide and seek leisure-time physical activity opinions and information. People who provided leisure-time physical activity opinions and information were more likely to seek opinions and information, and people who forwarded information about leisure-time physical activity were more likely to chat about it.

Conclusions
This study shed light on the application of the electronic word-of-mouth theoretical framework in promoting health behaviors. The findings can also guide the development of future social marketing interventions using social network sites to promote leisure-time physical activity.},

We developed a geographic information system to generate a comprehensive list of physical activity resources available within each census tract in the city.

The total number of physical activity resources varied by neighborhood {SES} (p {\textgreater} .05); low-{SES} (M = 4.5±2.3) and medium-{SES} (M = 4.9±2.6) neighborhoods had significantly fewer resources than high-{SES} (M = 8.4±3.5) neighborhoods. Low-, medium-, and high-{SES} neighborhoods did not differ on the number of pay-for-use facilities; however, low-{SES} (M = 3.1±1.5) and medium-{SES} (M = 3.8±1.6) neighborhoods had significantly fewer free-for-use resources than high- (M = 6.1±2.4) {SES} neighborhoods (p {\textgreater} .01).

However, enthusiasm for this topic continues to outstrip conceptual clarity, and there remains considerable uncertainty as to what is even meant by “emotion regulation.” The goal of this review is to examine the current status and future prospects of this rapidly growing field. In the first section, I define emotion and emotion regulation and distinguish both from related constructs. In the second section, I use the process model of emotion regulation to selectively review evidence that different regulation strategies have different consequences. In the third section, I introduce the extended process model of emotion regulation; this model considers emotion regulation to be one type of valuation, and distinguishes three emotion regulation stages (identification, selection, implementation). In the final section, I consider five key growth points for the field of emotion regulation.},

This report reviews subsequent underage drinking and related traffic fatality trends and research on determinants, consequences, and prevention interventions.Method:New research reports, meta-analyses, and systematic literature reviews were examined.Results:Since the Call to Action, reductions in underage frequency of drinking, heavy drinking occasions, and alcohol-related traffic deaths that began in the 1980s when the drinking age nationally became 21 have continued. Knowledge regarding determinants and consequences, particularly the effects of early-onset drinking, parental alcohol provision, and cognitive effects, has expanded. Additional studies support associations between the legal drinking age of 21, zero tolerance laws, higher alcohol prices, and reduced drinking and related problems. New research suggests that use/lose laws, social host liability, internal possession laws, graduated licensing, and night driving restrictions reduce traffic deaths involving underage drinking drivers. Additional studies support the positive effects of individually oriented interventions, especially screening and brief motivational interventions, web and face-to-face social norms interventions, college web-based interventions, parental interventions, and multicomponent community interventions.Conclusions:Despite reductions in underage alcohol consumption and related traffic deaths, underage drinking remains an enduring problem. Continued research is warranted in minimally studied areas, such as prospective studies of alcohol and brain development, policy studies of use/lose laws, internal possession laws, social host liability, and parent–family interventions.},

	abstract = {The analysis of experimental data with mixed-effects models requires decisions about the specification of the appropriate random-effects structure. Recently, Barr, Levy, Scheepers, and Tily, 2013 recommended fitting `maximal' models with all possible random effect components included. Estimation of maximal models, however, may not converge. We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification.},

However, limited research is available on what makes consumers share such information with others. This paper examines how self-relevance and self-construal affect the sharing of product harm information and the underlying processes that shape sharing. Five experiments demonstrate that under independent self-construal, highly self-relevant product harm information is less likely to be shared. The reluctance to share highly self-relevant information is attenuated under interdependent self-construal. The differential effects of self-construal are related to self-serving processes and motivations for sharing product harm information with others. The results apply to the sharing of negative information, but not positive information. Companies may use these findings to manage the diffusion of product harm information.},

Here, we review emerging research that bridges these levels of analysis by attempting to use group neural activity to forecast aggregate choice. A survey of initial findings suggests that components of group neural activity might forecast aggregate choice, in some cases even beyond traditional behavioral measures. In addition to demonstrating the plausibility of neuroforecasting, these findings raise the possibility that not all neural processes that predict individual choice forecast aggregate choice to the same degree. We propose that although integrative choice components may confer more consistency within individuals, affective choice components may generalize more broadly across individuals to forecast aggregate choice.},

Nationalistic ideologies tend to have firm categories and rules for what belongs to and represents the national culture. In a sample of 332 {UK} citizens, we tested whether strict categorization of stimuli and rules in objective cognitive tasks would be evident in strongly nationalistic individuals. Using voting behavior and attitudes from the United Kingdom’s 2016 {EU} referendum, we found that a flexible representation of national identity and culture was linked to cognitive flexibility in the ideologically neutral Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and Remote Associates Test, and to self-reported flexibility under uncertainty. Path analysis revealed that subjective and objective cognitive inflexibility predicted heightened authoritarianism, nationalism, conservatism, and system justification, and these in turn were predictive of support for Brexit and opposition to immigration, the European Union, and free movement of labor. This model accounted for 47.6\% of the variance in support for Brexit. Path analysis models were also predictive of participants’ sense of personal attachment to the United Kingdom, signifying that individual differences in cognitive flexibility may contribute toward ideological thinking styles that shape both nationalistic attitudes and personal sense of nationalistic identity. These findings further suggest that emotionally neutral “cold” cognitive information processing—and not just “hot” emotional cognition—may play a key role in ideological behavior and identity.},

Participants used pedometers for eight weekdays and recorded their step counts each evening. The descriptive norm group received feedback about the average number of steps taken by group members the previous day. The descriptive-plus-injunctive norm group received feedback about the group average, as well as a sad face if the participant was below the average or a happy face if the participant was above the average. The control group received no feedback throughout the study.{ResultsBy} days 7 and 8, the descriptive-plus-injunctive norm group reported significantly more steps relative to the control group, whereas the descriptive norm group showed a trend toward higher step counts relative to the control group.

	abstract = {Many behaviors that lead to worsened health outcomes are modifiable, social, and visible. Social influence has thus the potential to foster adoption of habits that promote health and improve disease management. In this study, we consider the evolution of the physical activity of 44.5 thousand Fitbit users as they interact on the Fitbit social network, in relation to their health status. The users collectively recorded 9.3 million days of steps over the period of a year through a Fitbit device. 7,515 of the users also self-reported whether they were diagnosed with a major chronic condition. A time-aggregated analysis shows that ego net size, average alter physical activity, gender, and body mass index ({BMI}) are significantly predictive of ego physical activity. For users who self-reported chronic conditions, the direction and effect size of associations varied depending on the condition, with diabetic users specifically showing almost a 6-fold increase in additional daily steps for each additional social tie. Subsequently, we consider the co-evolution of activity and friendship longitudinally on a month by month basis. We show that the fluctuations in average alter activity significantly predict fluctuations in ego activity. By leveraging a class of novel non-parametric statistical tests we investigate the causal factors in these fluctuations. We find that under certain stationarity assumptions, non-null causal dependence exists between ego and alter's activity, even in the presence of unobserved stationary individual traits. We believe that our findings provide evidence that the study of online social networks have the potential to improve our understanding of factors affecting adoption of positive habits, especially in the context of chronic condition management.},

Reviewed articles were required to be published in international academic peer-reviewed journals, or in full text from international scientific conferences, and focused on measuring physical activity through smartphone processing data and influencing people to be more active through smartphone applications.Study Appraisal and Synthesis {MethodsTwo} reviewers independently performed the selection of articles and examined titles and abstracts to exclude those out of scope. Data on study characteristics, technologies used to objectively measure physical activity, strategies applied to influence activity; and the main study findings were extracted and reported.{ResultsA} total of 26 articles (with the first published in 2007) met inclusion criteria. All studies were conducted in highly economically advantaged countries; 12 articles focused on special populations (e.g. obese patients). Studies measured physical activity using native mobile features, and/or an external device linked to an application. Measurement accuracy ranged from 52 to 100 \% (n = 10 studies). A total of 17 articles implemented and evaluated an intervention. Smartphone strategies to influence physical activity tended to be ad hoc, rather than theory-based approaches; physical activity profiles, goal setting, real-time feedback, social support networking, and online expert consultation were identified as the most useful strategies to encourage physical activity change. Only five studies assessed physical activity intervention effects; all used step counts as the outcome measure. Four studies (three pre–post and one comparative) reported physical activity increases (12–42 participants, 800–1,104 steps/day, 2 weeks–6 months), and one case-control study reported physical activity maintenance (n = 200 participants; {\textgreater}10,000 steps/day) over 3 months.{LimitationsSmartphone} use is a relatively new field of study in physical activity research, and consequently the evidence base is emerging.{ConclusionsFew} studies identified in this review considered the validity of phone-based assessment of physical activity. Those that did report on measurement properties found average-to-excellent levels of accuracy for different behaviors. The range of novel and engaging intervention strategies used by smartphones, and user perceptions on their usefulness and viability, highlights the potential such technology has for physical activity promotion. However, intervention effects reported in the extant literature are modest at best, and future studies need to utilize randomized controlled trial research designs, larger sample sizes, and longer study periods to better explore the physical activity measurement and intervention capabilities of smartphones.},

	abstract = {Background
The dramatic growth of Web 2.0 technologies and online social networks offers immense potential for the delivery of health behavior change campaigns. However, it is currently unclear how online social networks may best be harnessed to achieve health behavior change.

Objective
The intent of the study was to systematically review the current level of evidence regarding the effectiveness of online social network health behavior interventions.

Methods
Eight databases (Scopus, {CINAHL}, Medline, {ProQuest}, {EMBASE}, {PsycINFO}, Cochrane, Web of Science and Communication \& Mass Media Complete) were searched from 2000 to present using a comprehensive search strategy. Study eligibility criteria were based on the {PICOS} format, where “population” included child or adult populations, including healthy and disease populations; “intervention” involved behavior change interventions targeting key modifiable health behaviors (tobacco and alcohol consumption, dietary intake, physical activity, and sedentary behavior) delivered either wholly or in part using online social networks; “comparator” was either a control group or within subject in the case of pre-post study designs; “outcomes” included health behavior change and closely related variables (such as theorized mediators of health behavior change, eg, self-efficacy); and “study design” included experimental studies reported in full-length peer-reviewed sources. Reports of intervention effectiveness were summarized and effect sizes (Cohen’s d and 95\% confidence intervals) were calculated wherever possible. Attrition (percentage of people who completed the study), engagement (actual usage), and fidelity (actual usage/intended usage) with the social networking component of the interventions were scrutinized.

Results
A total of 2040 studies were identified from the database searches following removal of duplicates, of which 10 met inclusion criteria. The studies involved a total of 113,988 participants (ranging from n=10 to n=107,907). Interventions included commercial online health social network websites (n=2), research health social network websites (n=3), and multi-component interventions delivered in part via pre-existing popular online social network websites (Facebook n=4 and Twitter n=1). Nine of the 10 included studies reported significant improvements in some aspect of health behavior change or outcomes related to behavior change. Effect sizes for behavior change ranged widely from −0.05 (95\% {CI} 0.45-0.35) to 0.84 (95\% {CI} 0.49-1.19), but in general were small in magnitude and statistically non-significant. Participant attrition ranged from 0-84\%. Engagement and fidelity were relatively low, with most studies achieving 5-15\% fidelity (with one exception, which achieved 105\% fidelity).

Conclusions
To date there is very modest evidence that interventions incorporating online social networks may be effective; however, this field of research is in its infancy. Further research is needed to determine how to maximize retention and engagement, whether behavior change can be sustained in the longer term, and to determine how to exploit online social networks to achieve mass dissemination. Specific recommendations for future research are provided.},

	abstract = {Background
Physical activity helps people maintain a healthy weight and reduces the risk for several chronic diseases. Although this knowledge is widely recognized, adults and children in many countries around the world do not get recommended amounts of physical activity. Although many interventions are found to be ineffective at increasing physical activity or reaching inactive populations, there have been anecdotal reports of increased physical activity due to novel mobile games that embed game play in the physical world. The most recent and salient example of such a game is Pokémon Go, which has reportedly reached tens of millions of users in the United States and worldwide.

Objective
The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of Pokémon Go on physical activity.

Methods
We study the effect of Pokémon Go on physical activity through a combination of signals from large-scale corpora of wearable sensor data and search engine logs for 32,000 Microsoft Band users over a period of 3 months. Pokémon Go players are identified through search engine queries and physical activity is measured through accelerometers.

Results
We find that Pokémon Go leads to significant increases in physical activity over a period of 30 days, with particularly engaged users (ie, those making multiple search queries for details about game usage) increasing their activity by 1473 steps a day on average, a more than 25\% increase compared with their prior activity level (P{\textless}.001). In the short time span of the study, we estimate that Pokémon Go has added a total of 144 billion steps to {US} physical activity. Furthermore, Pokémon Go has been able to increase physical activity across men and women of all ages, weight status, and prior activity levels showing this form of game leads to increases in physical activity with significant implications for public health. In particular, we find that Pokémon Go is able to reach low activity populations, whereas all 4 leading mobile health apps studied in this work largely draw from an already very active population.

Conclusions
Mobile apps combining game play with physical activity lead to substantial short-term activity increases and, in contrast to many existing interventions and mobile health apps, have the potential to reach activity-poor populations. Future studies are needed to investigate potential long-term effects of these applications.},

Taking into account past and current {BMI} trends, it is anticipated that obesity will continue to take a significant ascent, as observed by the sharp increase from 1999 to 2008. Gender differences in {BMI} will continue to be as apparent, that is, women showing a higher {BMI} trend than men. In the coming years, the maximum mean {BMI} in more developed countries might be exceeded by those in less developed ones. Rather than focusing on obesity at the individual level, the immediate environment of the obese individual to broader socioeconomic contexts should be targeted.

	abstract = {Several studies have shown socioeconomic diﬀerences in leisure-time physical activity. One explanation may be socioeconomic diﬀerences in relevant psychosocial conditions. The Malmo¨ Diet and Cancer Study is a prospective cohort study including inhabitants in Malmo¨ , Sweden. The baseline questionnaire used in this cross-sectional study was completed by the 11,837 participants born 1926–1945 in 1992–1994. Leisure-time physical activity was measured by an item presenting a variety of activities. These activities were aggregated into a summary measure of leisure-time physical activity that takes both the intensity and duration of each speciﬁc activity into consideration. The eﬀects of the psychosocial variables on the socioeconomic diﬀerences in leisure-time physical activity were calculated in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. The quartile with the lowest degree of leisure-time physical activity was not evenly distributed between the socioeconomic groups. Socioeconomic diﬀerences were seen as odds ratios 1.5 for skilled and 1.5 for unskilled male manual workers, compared to the high level non-manual employees. An {OR} 1.6 was observed for female unskilled manual workers. Self-employed men and female pensioners also had a signiﬁcantly increased risk of low leisure-time physical activity. Adjustment for age, country of origin and previous/current diseases had no eﬀect on these {SES} diﬀerences. Finally, adjusting for social participation almost completely erased the {SES} diﬀerences. Among the psychosocial variables, social participation was the strongest predictor of low physical activity, and a strong predictor for socioeconomic diﬀerences in low leisure-time physical activity. Social participation measures the individual’s social activities in, for example political parties and organisations. It therefore seems possible that some of the socioeconomic diﬀerences in leisure-time physical activity are due to diﬀering social capital between socioeconomic groups. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Background: Data showing long term efficacy and sustained active lifestyle change are scant. Identifying social determinants for maintaining an active lifestyle overtime may help pinpoint barriers/facilitators for sustaining an active lifestyle change.
Methods: We evaluated the associations between social determinants of health ({SDH}) and changes in physical activity ({PA}). The analysis dataset included 3,741 participants in the Jackson Heart Study ({JHS}) who completed the {PA} questionnaire at exams 1 and 3, approximately 8 years apart. Participants were classified into 3 {PA} groups-poor (0 minutes/week moderate/vigorous activity), intermediate (some moderate/vigorous activity), or ideal (≥75 minutes/week vigorous or ≥150 minutes/week moderate or ≥150 minutes/week combined moderate/vigorous activity). {SDH} evaluated were individual level socioeconomic status ({SES}), social support, perceived stress and neighborhood characteristics. Other covariates included age, sex and body mass index ({BMI}). Unadjusted analyses followed by multivariable logistic regression analyses with backward selection were performed to explore the most significant {SDH} associated with changes in {PA}.
Results: Twenty-eight percent (28\%) participants had poor {PA} at both exams; 35.5\% had at least intermediate {PA} at both exams; 19.2\% changed from poor to intermediate/ideal {PA} and 17.8\% changed from intermediate/ideal to poor {PA} overtime. In unadjusted analyses, among participants with intermediate/ideal {PA} at exam 1, younger age, higher levels of {SES} and greater social support; as well as higher neighborhood {SES}, greater social cohesion, fewer neighborhood problems and violence were positively associated with maintaining intermediate/ideal {PA} at exam 3. Among those with poor {PA} at exam 1, the same factors other than social cohesion were associated with improved {PA} to moderate/ideal level at exam 3. Sex, perceived stress, number of {PA} facilities in the neighborhood or being overweight/obese at either exam was not associated with changes in physical activity levels. Exploratory multivariable logistic regression with backward selection suggested that all three individual {SES} indicators were important factors for maintaining moderate/ideal {PA} levels at exam 3; and younger age, higher education, and higher neighborhood {SES} were important factors for improving {PA} levels from poor to intermediate/ideal.
Conclusions: Individual {SES} indicators were significantly associated with maintaining an intermediate/ideal {PA} overtime; whereas younger age, higher educational attainment and higher neighborhood {SES} were significantly associated with changes in {PA} from poor to intermediate/ideal. Targeting individual education and environmental factors (e.g., neighborhood problems, violence) associated with neighborhood {SES} may provide most benefit both in initiating and maintaining an active lifestyle.},

Twenty-four months later, 85\% of subjects were resurveyed, and their physical activity levels were classified. Within each baseline category and gender subgroup, predictors of follow-up physical activity were identified. In multivariate analyses, adoption of vigorous exercise by sedentary men was predicted by self-efficacy, age (inverse), and neighborhood environment (inverse). Adoption by sedentary women was predicted by education, self-efficacy, and friend and family support for exercise. Maintenance of vigorous physical activity was predicted by self-efficacy and age (inverse) for initially active men and by education for initially active women. Conclusion. These results suggest that factors influencing adoption are different for men and women, and there may be different factors influencing adoption versus maintenance of vigorous physical activity.},

	abstract = {The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify individual, social, and environmental contributors (mediators) to individual- and area-level differences in leisure-time physical activity across socio-economic groups. A two-stage stratified sampling design was used to recruit 20–65 year old adults (N=2194) living in 154 census collection districts of Adelaide, Australia (overall response rate: 12\%). Participants completed two surveys six months apart (response rate on the second survey: 83\%). Individual-level socio-economic status ({SES}) was assessed using self-report measures on educational attainment, household income, and household size. Area-level {SES} was assessed using census data on median household income and household size for each selected census district. Bootstrap generalized linear models were used to examine associations between {SES}, potential mediators, and leisure-time physical activity. The product-of-coefficient test was used to estimate mediating effects. All {SES} measures were independently associated with potential individual and social mediators of the {SES}-activity relationships. Individual- and area-level income was also associated with perceived neighborhood attributes. Self-efficacy and social support for physical activity explained virtually all of the differences in physical activity across educational attainment groups. Physical barriers to walking and access to public open space contributed in part to the explanation of differences in recreational walking across income groups. Yet, self-efficacy and social support were the key mediators of the observed relationships between individual- and area-level income and physical activity. This study suggests that in order to increase physical activity participation in the more disadvantaged segments of the population, comprehensive, multilevel interventions targeting activity-related attitudes and skills as well as social and physical environments are needed.},

Understanding when and why the group self becomes more important than the individual self, and how this affects people’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, can help to prevent and redirect unwelcome aspects of human behavior by addressing them at the appropriate level of self.},

Here, we marshall evidence from developmental science, social psychology and neuroscience (including clinical neuropsychology) that support the view of a common representation network (both at the computational and neural levels) between self and other. However, sharedness does not mean identicality, otherwise representations of self and others would completely overlap, and lead to confusion. We argue that self-awareness and agency are integral components for navigating within these shared representations. We suggest that within this shared neural network the inferior parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex in the right hemisphere play a special role in interpersonal awareness.},

A quantitative, coordinate?based meta?analysis combined data from 303 participants across 19 functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and positron emission tomography ({PET}) studies to identify the differences in neural representation of abstract and concrete concepts. Studies that reported peak activations in standard space in contrast of abstract {\textgreater} concrete or concrete {\textgreater} abstract concepts at a whole brain level in healthy adults were included in this meta?analysis. Multilevel kernel density analysis ({MKDA}) was performed to identify the proportion of activated contrasts weighted by sample size and analysis type (fixed or random effects). Meta?analysis results indicated consistent and meaningful differences in neural representation for abstract and concrete concepts. Abstract concepts elicit greater activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus compared to concrete concepts, while concrete concepts elicit greater activity in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus compared to abstract concepts. These results suggest greater engagement of the verbal system for processing of abstract concepts and greater engagement of the perceptual system for processing of concrete concepts, likely via mental imagery.

	abstract = {We remember information that is congruent instead of incongruent with prior knowledge better, but the underlying neural mechanisms related to this enhancement are still relatively unknown. Recently, this memory enhancement due to a prior schema has been suggested to be based on rapid neocortical assimilation of new information, related to optimized encoding and consolidation processes. The medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}) is thought to be important in mediating this process, but its role in retrieval of schema-consistent information is still unclear. In this study, we regarded multisensory congruency with prior knowledge as a schema and used this factor to probe retrieval of consolidated memories either consistent or inconsistent with prior knowledge. We conducted a visuotactile learning paradigm in which participants studied visual motifs randomly associated with word–fabric combinations that were either congruent or incongruent with common knowledge. The next day, participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while their memory was tested. Congruent associations were remembered better than incongruent ones. This behavioral finding was parallelized by stronger retrieval-related activity in and connectivity between medial prefrontal and left somatosensory cortex. Moreover, we found a positive across-subject correlation between the connectivity enhancement and the behavioral congruency effect. These results show that successful retrieval of congruent compared to incongruent visuotactile associations is related to enhanced processing in an {mPFC}–somatosensory network, and support the hypothesis that new information that fits a preexisting schema is more rapidly assimilated in neocortical networks, a process that may be mediated, at least in part, by the {mPFC}.},

The framework includes a definition of schema as possessing four necessary and sufficient features, and four additional features schemas are sensitive to, which are not required but do play a frequent and central role in schema functions. Necessary schema features are (1) an associative network structure, (2) basis on multiple episodes, (3) lack of unit detail, and (4) adaptability. Features schemas are sensitive to are (5) chronological relationships, (6) hierarchical organization, (7) cross-connectivity, and (8) embedded response options. Additionally, we suggest that {vmPFC} activity observed in studies of schemas corresponds with participants' coordination of existing schemas with ongoing task demands.},

	abstract = {Various theories of moral cognition posit that moral intuitions can be understood as the output of a computational process performed over structured mental representations of human action. We propose that action plan diagrams — “act trees” — can be a useful tool for theorists to succinctly and clearly present their hypotheses about the information contained in these representations. We then develop a methodology for using a series of linguistic probes to test the theories embodied in the act trees. In Study 1, we validate the method by testing a specific hypothesis (diagrammed by act trees) about how subjects are representing two classic moral dilemmas and finding that the data support the hypothesis. In Studies 2-4, we explore possible explanations for discrete and surprising findings that our hypothesis did not predict. In Study 5, we apply the method to a less well-studied case and show how new experiments generated by our method can be used to settle debates about how actions are mentally represented. In Study 6, we argue that our method captures the mental representation of human action better than an alternative approach. A brief conclusion suggests that act trees can be profitably used in various fields interested in complex representations of human action, including law, philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, computer science, robotics and artificial intelligence.},

Instead, accounts of representation tend to either conflate these two or ignore the functional role aspect altogether. Here it is argued that by properly separating these two dimensions, we can gain a better understanding of the actual challenge we confront in explaining mental representation. Moreover, it is suggested that certain theories that have traditionally been viewed as competing accounts of representation should instead be treated as complementary accounts of these different dimensions. It is shown that by adopting this perspective, we can overcome certain traditional problems and also improve our understanding of empirical models of cognition, such as those that invoke cognitive maps in the hippocampus of animal brains.},

The device is willingly carried by a large fraction of people in developed countries, integrates a number of technologies for automatic observation, can be programmed to interact with the user, and can communicate with remote researchers. This allows unobtrusive and cost-effective access to previously inaccessible sources of data on everyday social behavior, such as physical proximity of people, phone calls, and patterns of movement. The authors describe three studies in human behavior that have augmented existing methods with the smartphone, two of which the authors conducted themselves. Based on their experience, the authors critically evaluate the improvements and threats to validity and reliability of smartphone-augmented methods. These approaches are rapidly becoming feasible for the social scientist, since research software for smartphones have been published in open source, which lowers the technical and economic investment needed for their utilization in research.},

We focus on the most tractable ingredient, hedonia or positive affect. A step toward happiness might be gained by improving the pleasures and positive moods in daily life. The neuroscience of pleasure and reward provides relevant insights, and we discuss how specific hedonic mechanisms might relate to happiness or the lack thereof. Although the neuroscience of happiness is still in its infancy, further advances might be made through mapping overlap between brain networks of hedonic pleasure with others, such as the brain's default network, potentially involved in the other happiness ingredient, eudaimonia or life meaning and engagement.},

This book is organized around 4 general issues or themes regarding the functions, causes, and effects of self-presentation in everyday life. The first 2 chapters provide us with a background for understanding self-presentation, with an emphasis on the tactics people use to manage their impressions. The 2nd issue we will address involves the question of why people are motivated to manage their impressions. The last portion of the book . . . examines the myriad of factors that affect the kinds of impressions people try to convey in a particular situation. Finally, the book concludes with a look at what happens, both behaviorally and emotionally, when people think they are making undesired impressions on other people.},

The architecture of {SNSs} provide opportunities to ask questions such as who am I; what matters to me; and, how do I want others to perceive me? Original research studies in this collection utilize both quantitative and qualitative methods to study a range of issues related to identity management on {SNSs} including authenticity, professional uses of {SNSs}, {LGBTQ} identities, and psychological and cultural impacts. Together, the contributors to this volume draw on current research in the field and offer new theoretical frameworks and research methods to further the conversation on impression management and {SNSs}, making this text essential for both students and scholars of social media.},

Two hundred and fourteen smokers participating in a smoking cessation study provided data during ad lib smoking at baseline. Participants recorded moods and activities each time they smoked and, for comparison, at randomly selected non-smoking occasions. Situational associations with smoking were captured by examining the associations between smoking and antecedents considered relevant to lapse risk: negative affect ({NA}), arousal, socializing with others, the presence of others smoking, and consumption of coffee and alcohol. The associations varied across participants, confirming individual differences in situational smoking associations. Survival analyses revealed that only the {NA} pattern predicted first lapse. The effect was only seen in {EMA} assessments of {NA} smoking, and was not captured by questionnaire measures of negative affect smoking, which did not predict lapse risk.

The neural correlates of {SV} are widespread and reliable, despite the wide variation in the range of values over which decisions are made (e.g., between goods worth a few dollars, in some cases, or hundreds of dollars, in others). According to adaptive coding theories (Barlow, 1961), an efficient value signal should exhibit range adaptation, such that neural activity maintains a fixed dynamic range, and the slope of the value response varies inversely with the range of values within the local context. Although monkey data have demonstrated range adaptation in single-unit correlates of value (Padoa-Schioppa, 2009; Kobayashi et al., 2010), whether {BOLD} value signals exhibit similar range adaptation is unknown. To test for this possibility, we presented human participants with choices between a fixed immediate and variable delayed payment options. Across two conditions, the delayed options' {SVs} spanned either a narrow or wide range. {SV}-tracking activity emerged in the posterior cingulate, ventral striatum, anterior cingulate, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Throughout this network, we observed evidence consistent with the predictions of range adaptation: the {SV} response slope increased in the narrow versus wide range, with statistically significant slope changes confirmed for the posterior cingulate and ventral striatum. No regions exhibited a reliably increased {BOLD} activity range in the wide versus narrow condition. Our observations of range adaptation present implications for the interpretation of {BOLD} {SV} responses that are measured across different contexts or individuals.},

	abstract = {Self-esteem has become a household word. Teachers, parents, therapists, and others have focused efforts on boosting self-esteem, on the assumption that high self-esteem will cause many positive outcomes and benefits—an assumption that is critically evaluated in this review.
Appraisal of the effects of self-esteem is complicated by several factors. Because many people with high self-esteem exaggerate their successes and good traits, we emphasize objective measures of outcomes. High self-esteem is also a heterogeneous category, encompassing people who frankly accept their good qualities along with narcissistic, defensive, and conceited individuals.
The modest correlations between self-esteem and school performance do not indicate that high self-esteem leads to good performance. Instead, high self-esteem is partly the result of good school performance. Efforts to boost the self-esteem of pupils have not been shown to improve academic performance and may sometimes be counterproductive. Job performance in adults is sometimes related to self-esteem, although the correlations vary widely, and the direction of causality has not been established. Occupational success may boost self-esteem rather than the reverse. Alternatively, self-esteem may be helpful only in some job contexts. Laboratory studies have generally failed to find that self-esteem causes good task performance, with the important exception that high self-esteem facilitates persistence after failure.
People high in self-esteem claim to be more likable and attractive, to have better relationships, and to make better impressions on others than people with low self-esteem, but objective measures disconfirm most of these beliefs. Narcissists are charming at first but tend to alienate others eventually. Self-esteem has not been shown to predict the quality or duration of relationships.
High self-esteem makes people more willing to speak up in groups and to criticize the group's approach. Leadership does not stem directly from self-esteem, but self-esteem may have indirect effects. Relative to people with low self-esteem, those with high self-esteem show stronger in-group favoritism, which may increase prejudice and discrimination.
Neither high nor low self-esteem is a direct cause of violence. Narcissism leads to increased aggression in retaliation for wounded pride. Low self-esteem may contribute to externalizing behavior and delinquency, although some studies have found that there are no effects or that the effect of self-esteem vanishes when other variables are controlled. The highest and lowest rates of cheating and bullying are found in different subcategories of high self-esteem.
Self-esteem has a strong relation to happiness. Although the research has not clearly established causation, we are persuaded that high self-esteem does lead to greater happiness. Low self-esteem is more likely than high to lead to depression under some circumstances. Some studies support the buffer hypothesis, which is that high self-esteem mitigates the effects of stress, but other studies come to the opposite conclusion, indicating that the negative effects of low self-esteem are mainly felt in good times. Still others find that high self-esteem leads to happier outcomes regardless of stress or other circumstances.
High self-esteem does not prevent children from smoking, drinking, taking drugs, or engaging in early sex. If anything, high self-esteem fosters experimentation, which may increase early sexual activity or drinking, but in general effects of self-esteem are negligible. One important exception is that high self-esteem reduces the chances of bulimia in females.
Overall, the benefits of high self-esteem fall into two categories: enhanced initiative and pleasant feelings. We have not found evidence that boosting self-esteem (by therapeutic interventions or school programs) causes benefits. Our findings do not support continued widespread efforts to boost self-esteem in the hope that it will by itself foster improved outcomes. In view of the heterogeneity of high self-esteem, indiscriminate praise might just as easily promote narcissism, with its less desirable consequences. Instead, we recommend using praise to boost self-esteem as a reward for socially desirable behavior and self-improvement.},

	shorttitle = {Understanding health behavior change among couples},
	abstract = {Marriage is a ubiquitous social status that consistently is linked to health. Despite this, there has been very little theory development or related research on the extent to which couple members are jointly motivated to and actively engage in health-enhancing behaviors. In this paper we propose an integrative model, based on interdependence theory and communal coping perspectives, that explicitly considers dyadic processes as determinants of couple behavior. Our integrated model applies these constructs to consider how couple dynamics might influence adoption of risk-reducing health habits. Accordingly, we suggest that the couple's interdependence can transform motivation from doing what is in the best interest of the self (person-centered), to doing even selfless actions that are best for the continuation of the relationship (relationship-centered). In turn, this transformation can lead to enhanced motivation for the couple to cope communally or act cooperatively in adopting health-enhancing behavior change. Implications for research related to couples and health behavior change are also highlighted.},

	abstract = {Objective: This research was designed to evaluate the relative contribution of social norms, demographics, drinking motives, and alcohol expectancies in predicting alcohol consumption and related problems among heavy-drinking college students. Method: Participants included 818 (57.6\% women) first-year undergraduates who reported at least one heavy-drinking episode in the previous month. In addition to providing demographic information (gender and fraternity/sorority membership) participants completed Web-based assessments of social norms (perceived descriptive norms regarding typical student drinking, injunctive norms regarding friends' and parents' approval), motives (social, enhancement, coping, and conformity), and expectancies and evaluations of positive and negative alcohol effects. Results: Regression results indicated that descriptive and injunctive norms were among the best predictors of college student drinking. With respect to alcohol problems, results indicated that coping motives accounted for the largest proportion of unique variance. Finally, results revealed that alcohol consumption mediated the relationships between predictors and problems for social norms, whereas coping motives, negative expectancies, and evaluation of negative effects were directly associated with alcohol problems despite having relatively weak or null unique associations with consumption. Conclusions: The results of this study substantiate social norms as being among the best predictors of alcohol consumption in this population and suggest that drinking to cope is a better predictor of problems. The findings are discussed in terms of practical prevention and treatment implications. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs 68: 556–565, 2007)},

A high proportion of negative online consumer reviews elicits a conformity effect. As the proportion of negative online consumer reviews increases, high-involvement consumers tend to conform to the perspective of reviewers, depending on the quality of the negative online consumer reviews; in contrast, low-involvement consumers tend to conform to the perspective of reviewers regardless of the quality of the negative online consumer reviews.

The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services gives rise to.

The present study bridges this research by examining the links among alcohol use, sleep, and academic performance in college students. Method: Personal interview surveys were conducted with a random sample of 236 students (124 women) at a liberal arts college. The interviews measured alcohol consumption, gender, academic class, weekday and weekend bedtimes and rise times, and daytime sleepiness; 95\% of the sample granted permission to obtain grade-point average ({GPA}) and Scholastic Aptitude Test ({SAT}) scores from official college records. Results: Ordinary least squares regressions showed that alcohol consumption was a significant predictor of four sleep patterns: the duration of sleep, the timing of sleep, the difference between weekday and weekend nighttime sleep hours (oversleep), and the difference between weekday and weekend bedtimes (bedtime delay). Women and students with late sleep schedules were more apt to report daytime sleepiness. {SAT} score was the strongest predictor of {GPA}. However, gender, alcohol consumption, sleep duration, and daytime sleepiness also were significant predictors when other variables were controlled. In addition to alcohol's direct relationship with {GPA}, mediational analysis indicated that alcohol had indirect effects on sleepiness and {GPA}, primarily through its effect on sleep schedule. Conclusions: The findings show how alcohol use among college students is related to sleep–wake patterns and further support the connection between alcohol use and grades. (J. Stud.

	abstract = {Background
The capacity of drug cues to elicit drug-seeking behavior is believed to play a fundamental role in drug dependence; yet the neurofunctional basis of human drug cue-reactivity is not fully understood. We performed a meta-analysis to identify brain regions that are consistently activated by presentation of drug cues. Studies involving treatment-seeking and nontreatment-seeking substance users were contrasted to determine whether there were consistent differences in the neural response to drug cues between these populations. Finally, to assess the neural basis of craving, consistency across studies in brain regions that show correlated activation with craving was assessed.
Methods
Appropriate studies, assessing the effect of drug-related cues or manipulations of drug craving in drug-user populations across the whole brain, were obtained via the {PubMed} database and literature search. Activation likelihood estimation, a method of quantitative meta-analysis that estimates convergence across experiments by modeling the spatial uncertainty of neuroimaging data, was used to identify consistent regions of activation.
Results
Cue-related activation was observed in the ventral striatum (across both subgroups), amygdala (in the treatment-seeking subgroup and overall), and orbitofrontal cortex (in the nontreatment-seeking subgroup and overall) but not insula cortex. Although a different pattern of frontal and temporal lobe activation between the subgroups was observed, these differences were not significant. Finally, right amygdala and left middle frontal gyrus activity were positively associated with craving.
Conclusions
These results substantiate the key neural substrates underlying reactivity to drug cues and drug craving.},

We analyzed over 3,000,000 tweets mentioning or replying to the 13 most influential users to determine audience sentiment. Twitter messages reflect the landscape of sentiment toward its most popular users. We used the sentiment analysis technique as a valid popularity indicator or measure. First, we distinguished between the positive and negative audiences of popular users. Second, we found that the sentiments expressed in the tweets by popular users influenced the sentiment of their audience. Third, from the above two findings we developed a positive-negative measure for this influence. Finally, using a Granger causality analysis, we found that the time-series-based positive-negative sentiment change of the audience was related to the real-world sentiment landscape of popular users. We believe that the positive-negative influence measure between popular users and their audience provides new insights into the influence of a user and is related to the real world.},

The current study aimed to identify lateral prefrontal brain areas associated with persuasive message viewing and understand how activity in these executive regions might interact with activity in the amygdala and medial {pFC}. Seventy adolescents were scanned using {fMRI} while they watched 10 strongly convincing antidrug public service announcements ({PSAs}), 10 weakly convincing antidrug {PSAs}, and 10 advertisements (ads) unrelated to drugs. Antidrug {PSAs} compared with nondrug ads more strongly elicited arousal-related activity in the amygdala and medial {pFC}. Within antidrug {PSAs}, those that were prerated as strongly persuasive versus weakly persuasive showed significant differences in arousal-related activity in executive processing areas of the lateral {pFC}. In support of the notion that persuasiveness involves both affective and executive processes, functional connectivity analyses showed greater coactivation between the lateral {pFC} and amygdala during {PSAs} known to be strongly (vs. weakly) convincing. These findings demonstrate that persuasive messages elicit activation in brain regions responsible for both emotional arousal and executive control and represent a crucial step toward a better understanding of the neural processes responsible for persuasion and subsequent behavior change.},

In social media, this relationship is rooted in a sender's expectations for audience response and the imagined responsive audience. Using experience sampling, we show that anticipated interaction varies across social media. Further, we outline the relational and situational factors associated with expecting response and the specificity of imagined responsive audience.

	abstract = {A substantial amount of research has focused on predicting the effectiveness of persuasive messages. However, characteristics of both the message itself and its receiver can impact theoretically predicted effects. For example, recent work published in this journal demonstrated that issue involvement modulates the relationship between message sensation value ({MSV}) and argument strength ({AS}). When exposed to anti-cannabis public service announcements ({PSAs}), high-drug-risk individuals rate these messages as having low effectiveness regardless of variation in {MSV} and {AS}. Accordingly, for high-risk individuals, {MSV} and {AS} lose their predictive power in message design; moreover, the all too common use of high {MSV}, high {AS} {PSAs} to dissuade drug use may be ineffective, as high-risk viewers are more likely to engage in counterarguing. In this paper, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural correlates of counterarguing. Subsequently, we employ a brain-as-predictor approach using neural activation and self-report data to predict message effectiveness in two independent samples. We demonstrate that by adding two neural predictors within the middle frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus to self-report data, the prediction accuracy of message effectiveness in high-drug-risk individuals during counterarguing can reach, and even surpass, the prediction accuracy for low-drug-risk individuals.},

	abstract = {Presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

Communications systems operate through two pathways. In the direct pathway, they promote changes by informing, enabling, motivating, and guiding participants. In the socially mediated pathway, media influences link participants to social networks and community settings that provide natural incentives and continued personalized guidance, for desired change. Social cognitive theory analyzes social diffusion of new styles of behavior in terms of the psychosocial factors governing their acquisition and adoption and the social networks through which they spread and are supported. Structural interconnectedness provides potential diffusion paths; sociocognitive factors largely determine what diffuses through those paths.},

	abstract = {People are exposed to persuasive communication across many different contexts: Governments, companies, and political parties use persuasive appeals to encourage people to eat healthier, purchase a particular product, or vote for a specific candidate. Laboratory studies show that such persuasive appeals are more effective in influencing behavior when they are tailored to individuals’ unique psychological characteristics. However, the investigation of large-scale psychological persuasion in the real world has been hindered by the questionnaire-based nature of psychological assessment. Recent research, however, shows that people’s psychological characteristics can be accurately predicted from their digital footprints, such as their Facebook Likes or Tweets. Capitalizing on this form of psychological assessment from digital footprints, we test the effects of psychological persuasion on people’s actual behavior in an ecologically valid setting. In three field experiments that reached over 3.5 million individuals with psychologically tailored advertising, we find that matching the content of persuasive appeals to individuals’ psychological characteristics significantly altered their behavior as measured by clicks and purchases. Persuasive appeals that were matched to people’s extraversion or openness-to-experience level resulted in up to 40\% more clicks and up to 50\% more purchases than their mismatching or unpersonalized counterparts. Our findings suggest that the application of psychological targeting makes it possible to influence the behavior of large groups of people by tailoring persuasive appeals to the psychological needs of the target audiences. We discuss both the potential benefits of this method for helping individuals make better decisions and the potential pitfalls related to manipulation and privacy.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the symbiotic relationship between social, commercial, and                    critical marketing thought. Marketers seek to influence consumer behaviour. Much                    ill health and many social problems are caused by human behaviour. Social                    marketing puts these two phenomena together and uses marketing insights to                    address social behaviours. In the process both arms of the discipline can                    benefit, and this paper illustrates this using the examples of exchange theory                    and relational thinking. Social marketing also recognizes environmental                    influences on behaviour and that commercial marketing can be an important part                    of this influence. The case of tobacco is used to show that this influence can                    be malignant, and that as a result marketing has come under unprecedented                    scrutiny. Social marketing’s understanding of both the commercial and                    social sectors puts it in a unique position to provide realistic critiques of                    marketing and identify intelligent solutions. The paper concludes that                    socialmarketing will flourish by exploiting its twin understanding of the good                    and the bad that marketing can bring to society.},

Surprisingly, investigation into the neural underpinnings of social desirability has been limited and focused only on interindividual differences in dopamine receptor binding. These studies revealed reduced dopamine receptor binding in the striatum of individuals who are high in trait social desirability. Interestingly, high dopamine signaling has been associated with low white-matter integrity, irrespective of social desirability. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that a positive association exists between trait social desirability and the white-matter microstructure of the external capsule, which carries fibers to the striatum from the prefrontal cortex. To test this hypothesis, we collected diffusion tensor imaging data and examined the relationship between fractional anisotropy of the external capsule and participants’ social desirability—our analysis revealed a positive association. As a second exploratory step, we examined the association between social desirability and white-matter microstructure throughout the whole brain. Our whole-brain analysis revealed associations within multiple major white-matter tracts, demonstrating that socially desirable behavior relies on connectivity between distributed brain regions.},

In this research, the authors suggest that ambivalence can also create the opposite effect: avoidance of thinking about persuasive messages. If processing is intended to reduce experienced ambivalence, then ambivalent people should increase processing of information perceived as proattitudinal (agreeable) and able to decrease ambivalence. However, ambivalence should also lead people to avoid processing of counterattitudinal (disagreeable) information that threatens to increase ambivalence. Three studies provide evidence consistent with this proposal. When participants were relatively ambivalent, they processed messages to a greater extent when the messages were proattitudinal rather than counterattitudinal. However, when participants were relatively unambivalent, they processed messages more when the messages were counterattitudinal rather than proattitudinal. In addition, ambivalent participants perceived proattitudinal messages as more likely than counterattitudinal messages to reduce ambivalence, and these perceptions accounted for message position effects on amount of processing.},

Methods: The article describes three types of media campaigns on student drinking: information, social norms marketing, and advocacy. Key principles of campaign design are derived from work in commercial marketing, advertising, and public relations and from evaluations of past public health campaigns. Results: Information campaigns on the dangers of high-risk drinking are common, but none has been rigorously evaluated. Quasi-experimental studies suggest that social norms marketing campaigns, which correct misperceptions of campus drinking norms, may be effective, but more rigorous research is needed. As of this writing, only one major media campaign has focused on policy advocacy to reduce college student drinking, but it is still being evaluated. Lessons for campaign design are organized as a series of steps for campaign development, implementation and assessment: launch a strategic planning process, select a strategic objective, select the target audience, develop a staged approach, define the key promise, avoid fear appeals, select the right message source, select a mix of media channels, maximize media exposure, conduct formative research, and conduct process and outcome evaluations. Conclusions: Future campaigns should integrate information, social norms marketing, and advocacy approaches to create a climate of support for institutional, community and policy changes that will alter the environment in which students make decisions about their alcohol consumption.},

Psychologists have traditionally used self-report measures and performance on laboratory tasks to achieve this end. However, these measures are limited in their ability to predict behavior in certain contexts. We argue that current neuroscientific knowledge has reached a point where it can complement other existing psychological measures in predicting behavior and other important outcomes. This brain-as-predictor approach integrates traditional neuroimaging methods with measures of behavioral outcomes that extend beyond the immediate experimental session. Previously, most neuroimaging experiments focused on understanding basic psychological processes that could be directly observed in the laboratory. However, recent experiments have demonstrated that brain measures can predict outcomes (e.g., purchasing decisions, clinical outcomes) over longer timescales in ways that go beyond what was previously possible with self-report data alone. This approach can be used to reveal the connections between neural activity in laboratory contexts and longer-term, ecologically valid outcomes. We describe this approach and discuss its potential theoretical implications. We also review recent examples of studies that have used this approach, discuss methodological considerations, and provide specific guidelines for using it in future research.},

	abstract = {Adolescence is a period characterized by increased sensitivity to social cues, as well as increased risk-taking in the presence of peers. For example, automobile crashes are the leading cause of death for adolescents, and driving with peers increases the risk of a fatal crash. Growing evidence points to an interaction between neural systems implicated in cognitive control and social and emotional context in predicting adolescent risk. We tested such a relationship in recently licensed teen drivers. Participants completed an {fMRI} session in which neural activity was measured during a response inhibition task, followed by a separate driving simulator session 1 week later. Participants drove alone and with a peer who was randomly assigned to express risk-promoting or risk-averse social norms. The experimentally manipulated social context during the simulated drive moderated the relationship between individual differences in neural activity in the hypothesized cognitive control network (right inferior frontal gyrus, {BG}) and risk-taking in the driving context a week later. Increased activity in the response inhibition network was not associated with risk-taking in the presence of a risky peer but was significantly predictive of safer driving in the presence of a cautious peer, above and beyond self-reported susceptibility to peer pressure. Individual differences in recruitment of the response inhibition network may allow those with stronger inhibitory control to override risky tendencies when in the presence of cautious peers. This relationship between social context and individual differences in brain function expands our understanding of neural systems involved in top–down cognitive control during adolescent development.},

This association has usually been attributed to the influence of social networks on individual behavior.

The present study used longitudinal data and structural equation modeling to compare the selection and influence effects among a large representative sample of adults. Results suggested that both selection and influence affect the association between individual and network drinking patterns among adults, but that social selection effects are substantially stronger than social influence effects. A cross-lagged structural equation model with a normed fit index of .975, showed that the path indicating peer influence had a coefficient of .069 (P{\textless}.01), whereas the path indicating network selection had a coefficient of .193 (P{\textless}.01).

However, little is known about the effects of social online activity on health behaviors. The authors examined the use of {SNSs} among friends and the degree to which {SNS} activities relate to face-to-face peer influences and adolescent risk behaviors. Longitudinal egocentric friendship network data along with adolescent social media use and risk behaviors were collected from 1,563 10th-grade students across five Southern California high schools. Measures of online and offline peer influences were computed and assessed using fixed-effects models. The frequency of adolescent {SNS} use and the number of their closest friends on the same {SNSs} were not significantly associated with risk behaviors. However, exposure to friends' online pictures of partying or drinking was significantly associated with both smoking (β = .11, p {\textless} .001) and alcohol use (β = .06, p {\textless} .05). Whereas adolescents with drinking friends had higher risk levels for drinking, adolescents without drinking friends were more likely to be affected by higher exposure to risky online pictures (β = −.10, p {\textless} .05). Myspace and Facebook had demographically distinct user characteristics and differential effects on risk behaviors. Exposure to risky online content had a direct impact on adolescents' risk behaviors and significantly interacted with risk behaviors of their friends. These results provide evidence that friends' online behaviors should be considered a viable source of peer influence and that increased efforts should focus on educating adolescents on the negative effects of risky online displays.},

	abstract = {Objective: Social factors affect alcohol use and misuse, yet researchers rarely study the acute effects of alcohol in groups. This study used systematic observation techniques to measure the effects of alcohol on behavioral responses during an initial group interaction. Method: Fifty-four male social drinkers were assembled into three-person groups of strangers, and all members of each group were administered either a 0.82 g/kg dose of alcohol or a placebo to be consumed during a 30-minute period. This social interaction was video recorded, and the duration and sequence of selected smiling and speech behaviors were coded on a 1-second time base. Results: Alcohol consumption increased individual- and group-level coordination of smiling and speech behaviors over time and improved self-reported bonding. Conclusions: These data suggest that alcohol may facilitate social bonding during initial group formation. Measuring behavioral responses in a social context provides new directions for studying the acute effects of alcohol. (J. Stud. Alcohol 67: 785-793, 2006)},

	abstract = {Parents, public health officials, college personnel, and society at-large continue to be concerned about the increase in heavy drinking that occurs across the transition to college, prompting alcohol researchers to continue the search for effective interventions. In this report we use data from a large (N=3720) prospective study to (1) estimate how predictable heavy drinking in the first semester of college is on the basis of information obtained prior to college and (2) identify precollege variables that are important predictors of heavy drinking in the first semester. We found that first-semester heavy drinking is highly predictable, primarily because of continuity from precollege heavy drinking, but also from precollege peer drinking norms, precollege other substance use (esp. tobacco use), and precollege party motivation for attending college. These findings have implications for both the timing and targets of interventions. Interventions timed to occur prior to college and/or in the early months of college may disrupt the momentum of previously established drinking behavior. Furthermore, interventions may be most effective if they target conjoint alcohol and tobacco use, college party motivation, and self-selection into heavy-drinking social environments.},

Questionnaires were completed by a representative national sample (n = 17,592) of students on 140 campuses in 1993. Binge drinking was defined as five or more drinks per episode for men and as four or more drinks per episode for women. {RESULTS}. Overall, 44\% of the students (50\% of the men and 39\% of the women) binged. While demographic factors such as sex and race were significantly related to binge drinking, prior binging in high school was crucial, suggesting that for many students, binge drinking begins before college. The strongest predictors of college binge drinking were residence in a fraternity or sorority, adoption of a party-centered life-style, and engagement in other risky behaviors. {CONCLUSIONS}. Interventions must be targeted at high school binge drinking as well as at several characteristics of college life--most notably fraternity residence. Legal drinking age fails to predict binge drinking, raising questions about the effectiveness of the legal minimum drinking age of 21 in college alcohol policies.},

Social motives appear to be associated with moderate alcohol use, enhancement with heavy drinking, and coping motives with alcohol-related problems. However, an enormous heterogeneity was found in terms of how motives were measured: 10 to 40 items were grouped into between 2 and 10 dimensions and sometimes the same items occurred under different dimensions. Future studies should therefore use well-defined, theoretically based, homogenous instruments to disentangle cultural from measurement differences across surveys.},

Modeling occurs when the student's behavior corresponds to another student's concurrent drinking behavior. Perceived social norms can serve to make excessive alcohol use appear common and acceptable to the student.

As a result, consistent self-other discrepancies ({SODs}) have been observed, in which self-perceptions of drinking behaviors and approval of drinking usually are lower than comparable judgments of others. These {SODs} form the foundation of the currently popular "social norms approach" to alcohol abuse prevention, which conveys to students the actual campus norms regarding drinking behaviors and approval of alcohol use. However, little attention has been paid to the factors that can influence the magnitude of {SODs}. This research was conducted to address these issues. Method: This meta-analytic integration of 23 studies evaluated the influence of five predictors of {SODs}: norm type (injunctive or descriptive), gender, reference group, question specificity and campus size. These studies rendered 102 separate tests of {SODs} in descriptive and injunctive forms, representing the responses of 53,825 participants. Results: All five predictors were significantly related to self-other differences in the perception of norms. Greater {SODs} were evident for injunctive norms, estimates by women, distal reference groups and nonspecific questions, as well as on smaller campuses. Conclusions: More systematic attention should be given to how norms are assessed. In particular, {SODs} can be maximized or minimized, depending on the specificity of the behaviors/attitudes evaluated and the reference groups chosen for comparison.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study examined the effectiveness of three peer-facilitated brief alcohol interventions—small group motivational interviewing, motivationally enhanced peer theater, and an interactive alcohol-education program—with students engaging in high-risk drinking who were referred for alcohol policy violations. Method: Undergraduate students referred for alcohol policy violations (N = 695) at a large northeastern public university were randomized to one of the three conditions. Six-month follow-up data were collected on drinking frequency and quantity, negative consequences, use of protective behaviors, and perceptions of peers' drinking norms. Results: There were no statistically significant overall pre-post effects or treatment effects. However, exploratory analyses indicated that decreases in perceived norms and increases in use of protective behavioral strategies were associated with reductions in alcohol use and alcohol-related problems at follow-up (p {\textless} .01). Conclusions: The presence of nonsignificant pre-post or main effects is, in part, consistent with recent research indicating that sanctioned college students may immediately reduce drinking in response to citation and that brief interventions may not contribute to additional behavioral change. The presence of statistically significant correlations between alcohol use and related problems with corrections in norms misperceptions and increased use of protective behaviors at the individual level holds promise for both research and practice. The integration of elements addressing social norms and use of protective behaviors within brief cognitive-behavioral intervention protocols delivered by trained peer facilitators warrants further study using randomized clinical trials.

	abstract = {Objective: Although studies consistently have found a negative bivariate association between alcohol use and academic performance among college students, some research suggests that this association largely results from student differences at matriculation. The present study examines this relationship while controlling for key background factors. Method: Personal interview surveys were conducted for four consecutive semesters with random samples of students at a small, liberal arts college, resulting in a combined sample of 754 (392 women). The interviews measured alcohol consumption, gender, race, athletic status, academic class, parents' education and income, and frequency of attending off-campus parties; and 94\% of the sample granted permission to obtain grade point average ({GPA}), high school class rank, and Scholastic Aptitude Test ({SAT}) scores from official college records. Results: The amount of alcohol consumed correlated significantly with {GPA} (r = −.26). Ordinary least squares regressions showed that gender and partying accounted for 43\% of variation in alcohol consumption, and that academic class and parents' income had positive indirect effects on consumption. {SAT} score and class rank were the strongest predictors of {GPA}, but alcohol consumption remained significant when these and other variables were controlled (β = −.24 when controlling for {SAT}, and β = −.14 when controlling for both {SAT} and class rank in a smaller, biased subsample). Conclusions: The disparity in findings between this and previous research was explained in terms of differences in type of institution studied, which suggests the need to consider the college context and the interaction of college and individual factors in studies of college drinking.

This study aims to analyze population-based data from a module of questions on binge drinking among U.S. adults to assess the number of drinks consumed by binge drinkers and the associated independent risk factors for consuming more drinks. Data were analyzed from 14,143 adult binge drinkers who responded to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System binge drinking module in 2003 and 2004. Total drinks were calculated by summing the total number of beer, wine, and liquor-containing drinks consumed during a respondents' most recent binge drinking episode. Binge drinkers consumed an average of 8.0 drinks (median 6) during their most recent binge drinking episode; 70.0\% of binge drinkers consumed six or more drinks, and 38.4\% consumed eight or more drinks. Men consumed more drinks during their last binge episode than women (M=8.3 vs 7.0, median=7 vs 6), and those aged 18–34 years consumed more drinks than those aged {\textgreater}34 years for both men and women. Independent risk factors for consuming eight or more drinks included being male; being aged {\textless}35 years; being other than white race/ethnicity; having less education; not being married; binge drinking three or more times in the past 30 days; and drinking mostly beer. Most adult binge drinkers drink in excess of the five-drink threshold defining this risky behavior. The intensity of binge drinking should be monitored regularly by health agencies to improve surveillance and to better assess the impact of interventions designed to reduce binge drinking and its consequences.},

Young people aged 10–24 years represent 27\% of the world's population. Although important health problems and risk factors for disease in later life emerge in these years, the contribution to the global burden of disease is unknown. We describe the global burden of disease arising in young people and the contribution of risk factors to that burden. We used data from {WHO}'s 2004 Global Burden of Disease study. Cause-specific disability-adjusted life-years ({DALYs}) for young people aged 10–24 years were estimated by {WHO} region on the basis of available data for incidence, prevalence, severity, and mortality. {WHO} member states were classified into low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries, and into {WHO} regions. We estimated {DALYs} attributable to specific global health risk factors using the comparative risk assessment method. {DALYs} were divided into years of life lost because of premature mortality ({YLLs}) and years lost because of disability ({YLDs}), and are presented for regions by sex and by 5-year age groups. The total number of incident {DALYs} in those aged 10–24 years was about 236 million, representing 15·5\% of total {DALYs} for all age groups. Africa had the highest rate of {DALYs} for this age group, which was 2·5 times greater than in high-income countries (208 vs 82 {DALYs} per 1000 population). Across regions, {DALY} rates were 12\% higher in girls than in boys between 15 and 19 years (137 vs 153). Worldwide, the three main causes of {YLDs} for 10–24-year-olds were neuropsychiatric disorders (45\%), unintentional injuries (12\%), and infectious and parasitic diseases (10\%). The main risk factors for incident {DALYs} in 10–24-year-olds were alcohol (7\% of {DALYs}), unsafe sex (4\%), iron deficiency (3\%), lack of contraception (2\%), and illicit drug use (2\%). The health of young people has been largely neglected in global public health because this age group is perceived as healthy. However, opportunities for prevention of disease and injury in this age group are not fully exploited. The findings from this study suggest that adolescent health would benefit from increased public health attention. None.},

	abstract = {Drinking identity is a component of identity that is associated with heavier drinking and more negative alcohol-related consequences. Social identity is displayed through social networking sites, which are being used on a daily basis by millions of young adults. The current research provides insight into understanding for whom social network sites are more strongly associated with alcohol use by examining the potentially interactive effects of Facebook use and drinking identity. We explored whether the association between alcohol-related posts on Facebook and drinking differs based on the extent to which students identify with drinking. Undergraduates (N = 109) provided researchers access to their Facebook profile before completing an online survey assessing their drinking identity and alcohol use (i.e., drinks per week, frequency, typical drinking, peak drinks). Their previous 100 Facebook posts (e.g., status updates, photos) were coded for alcohol-related content. Results using negative binomial regression analyses indicated significant interactions between alcohol-related Facebook posts and drinking identity in predicting all indicators of alcohol use. The direction of the simple effects suggested that the association between alcohol-related Facebook posts and drinking was stronger for individuals with lower drinking identity. Findings extend the literature on risk for drinking by incorporating social network use and drinking identity and suggest that future interventions utilizing social networks may wish to target those at traditionally lower risk. Implications and future directions are discussed.},

	abstract = {Cue-reactivity is thought to play a fundamental role in the maintenance of addiction. The incentive sensitization theory proposes that conditioned responses are related to increased sensitivity of the reward-related dopaminergic pathways in the brain. However, neuroimaging studies on alcohol cue-reactivity show inconsistent results. Stimuli content of 26 alcohol cue-reactivity studies was systematically reviewed. No differences were found between alcoholic beverage stimuli and non-alcoholic beverage stimuli in human display and brand factors; however, alcoholic beverage stimuli were more likely to display social interaction compared to non-alcoholic beverage stimuli. Given that processing of social information activates brain areas that partly overlap with reward-related brain areas associated with cue-reactivity, such differences between conditions can introduce noise in the findings. We therefore suggest matching stimuli sets on the reviewed factors carefully to improve reliability of neuroimaging studies investigating alcohol-related cue-reactivity.},

For data analysis we used a Multilevel Logistic Regression for repeated measures adjusting for alcohol and cannabis use. The incidence rate of alcohol-related injuries was 0.028year−1 for females and 0.036year−1 for males. The multivariate analysis showed that among females a high frequency of {HED} and use of cannabis are risk factors for alcohol-related injuries (Odds Ratio [{OR}]=2.64 and {OR}=3.68), while being more than 23 is a protective factor ({OR}=0.34). For males, bivariate analysis also showed {HED} like risk factor ({OR}=4.69 and {OR}=2.51). Finally, the population attributable fraction for {HED} among females was 37.12\%. {HED} leads to an increase of alcohol-related injuries in both sexes and being over 23 years old acts as a protective factor among women. Our results suggest that about one third of alcohol-related injuries among women could be avoided by removing {HED}.},

In the present study, college students (N = 90) used a social interaction diary to provide measures of their social activity, and they provided descriptions of their total alcohol consumption and of their frequency of binge drinking. Although total consumption per se was not reliably related to the quality or quantity of participants' social lives, frequency of binge drinking was related to some aspects of social interaction. Specifically, participants who had no binge-drinking episodes reported less intimacy and less disclosure in their interactions than those who had some episodes. However, men who reported having three or more binge episodes per week experienced less intimacy in their interactions than any other group of men or women. It is possible that because some binge drinking is normative and may be seen as desirable among college students, students who have a more normative number of binge-drinking episodes are integrated more fully into the college community than students who have no episodes or too many episodes.},

Enhancement and coping motives are mostly positively related and conformity motives are mostly negatively related with heavy drinking. Relations are less clear for social motives. This study aimed at gaining more insight in the role of drinking motives in heavy drinking students. Overall, 15 897 Belgian university and college students (mean age: 20.7, {SD} = 2.6) anonymously participated in an online survey. Logistic regressions tested relationships between motives and problematic drinking (\&gt;weekly drinking, ≥monthly binge drinking and being at risk for problematic drinking by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [{AUDIT}]). Social motives had the highest prevalence, followed by enhancement, coping and conformity motives. Men engaged more in problematic drinking and reported more motives, except for coping. Enhancement, coping and social-motivated students have higher chances for problematic drinking, while the opposite is true for conformity-motivated students. Although this study found a similar ranking of motives as in other studies, a relationship between problematic drinking and all motives, including social motives, was revealed. This might indicate the different functions of social motives in heavy drinking in different cultures/sub-populations and countries. This finding is relevant for the development of interventions.},

	abstract = {Objective: Findings from previous prospective research suggest the association between alcohol use and undergraduate academic performance is negligible. This study was designed to address weaknesses of the past research by relying on objective measures of both drinking and academic performance. Method: A prospective study was conducted with repeated measures of exposure to alcohol linked to institutional academic records. Alcohol data were collected in residence halls at a nonselective, midwestern, public university in the United States. A total of 659 first- and second-year undergraduate students were tracked over the course of 15-week semesters. Results: A statistically significant negative association with semester academic performance was found for different alcohol indicators: frequency of breath alcohol concentration ({BrAC}) above .08, mean {BrAC}, standard deviation, and maximum {BrAC} recorded. These associations remained statistically significant when controlled for sociodemographic variables and individual level confounders, but the effect sizes were relatively small with a contribution to explained variance of less than 1\%. When additionally adjusted for residence hall building, all alcohol indicators no longer reached statistical significance (p ≥ .05). Conclusions: Consistent with past prospective research, the magnitude of the association between undergraduate alcohol use and academic performance is small when the effects of high school academic aptitude and performance are accounted for in multivariable analyses. This is the first study to find that living environment may have a robust effect on the academic achievement of undergraduates. Future research should examine more closely the relation between residence and academic performance and the role that alcohol use may play in creating residential environments. (J. Stud.

In an original experiment, dyads of friends or strangers disclosed to one another in text-based {CMC}. After their discussion, a questionnaire assessed participants' liking toward their partners as well as their attributions regarding their partners' behavior. Results show that self-disclosure prompted receivers' interpersonal attributions, which led receivers to like their partners. But, receivers' interpersonal attributions did not lead to reciprocal disclosure. The results corroborate Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock’s (2011) model that links self-disclosure and liking by way of interpersonal attributions, and demonstrate one disclosure-liking effect in {CMC}: People like those who self-disclose to them. This study provides further evidence for {CMC}'s unique impact on the relationship between self-disclosure and liking, and contributes to our understanding of the interpersonal processes that lead to liking in {CMC}.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Evidence suggests that physical activity is positively related to several aspects of cognitive functioning in children, among which is selective attention. To date, no information is available on the optimal frequency of physical activity on cognitive functioning in children. The current study examined the acute effects of one and two bouts of moderate-intensity physical activity on children's selective attention.
{DESIGN}: Randomized controlled trial ({ISRCTN}97975679).
{METHODS}: Thirty boys and twenty-six girls, aged 10-13 years, were randomly assigned to three conditions: (A) sitting all morning working on simulated school tasks; (B) one 20-min physical activity bout after 90min; and (C) two 20-min physical activity bouts, i.e. at the start and after 90min. Selective attention was assessed at five time points during the morning (i.e. at baseline and after 20, 110, 130 and 220min), using the 'Sky Search' subtest of the 'Test of Selective Attention in Children'. We used {GEE} analysis to examine differences in Sky Search scores between the three experimental conditions, adjusting for school, baseline scores, self-reported screen time and time spent in sports.
{RESULTS}: Children who performed two 20-min bouts of moderate-intensity physical activity had significantly better Sky Search scores compared to children who performed one physical activity bout or remained seated the whole morning (B=-0.26; 95\% {CI}=[-0.52; -0.00]).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings support the importance of repeated physical activity during the school day for beneficial effects on selective attention in children.},

Areas of research focused more within species, such as hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents, also provide crucial insight into the protective role of physical activity.

Sixty-two healthy elderly individuals were assessed for level of physical activity, aerobic fitness, episodic memory score, neurotrophin and catecholamine levels, and received a magnetic resonance image of the brain at baseline and after a six months intervention of medium or low-intensity physical activity or control. Increase in total physical activity was positively associated with increase in memory score over the entire cohort, without significant differences between intensity groups. It was also positively associated with increases in local gray matter volume in prefrontal and cingulate cortex, and {BDNF} levels (trend). In conclusion, we showed that physical activity conveys the beneficial effects on memory function independently of its intensity, possibly mediated by local gray matter volume and neurotrophic factors. Our findings may carry significant implications for prevention of cognitive decline in the elderly.},

	abstract = {Scientific evidence is accumulating on physical activity as a means for the primary prevention of cancer. Nearly 170 observational epidemiologic studies of physical activity and cancer risk at a number of specific cancer sites have been conducted. The evidence for decreased risk with increased physical activity is classified as convincing for breast and colon cancers, probable for prostate cancer, possible for lung and endometrial cancers and insufficient for cancers at all other sites. Despite the large number of studies conducted on physical activity and cancer, most have been hampered by incomplete assessment of physical activity and a lack of full examination of effect modification and confounding. Several plausible hypothesized biological mechanisms exist for the association between physical activity and cancer, including changes in endogenous sexual and metabolic hormone levels and growth factors, decreased obesity and central adiposity and possibly changes in immune function. Weight control may play a particularly important role because links between excess weight and increased cancer risk have been established for several sites, and central adiposity has been particularly implicated in promoting metabolic conditions amenable to carcinogenesis. Based on existing evidence, some public health organizations have issued physical activity guidelines for cancer prevention, generally recommending at least 30 min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity on ≥5 d/wk. Although most research has focused on the efficacy of physical activity in cancer prevention, evidence is increasing that exercise also influences other aspects of the cancer experience, including cancer detection, coping, rehabilitation and survival after diagnosis.},

It was suggested that, relative to indirect experience, behavioral experience may facilitate the attitude formation process and increase attitude accessibility once the attitude is formed. A second experiment found support for both of these notions. Two additional experiments indicated that repeated association of the attitude object and the attitudinal evaluation enhanced both attitude accessibility and attitude-behavior consistency. It was suggested that the strength of the object-evaluation association is a critical determinant of accessibility, which, in turn, acts as a central factor in the process by which attitudes affect later behavior. It was further suggested that the manner of attitude formation affects attitude-behavior consistency because direct experience produces a stronger object-evaluation association and, hence, a more accessible attitude than does indirect experience.},

	abstract = {We review the psychology and neuroscience of reinforcement learning ({RL}), which has experienced significant progress in the past two decades, enabled by the comprehensive experimental study of simple learning and decision-making tasks. However, one challenge in the study of {RL} is computational: The simplicity of these tasks ignores important aspects of reinforcement learning in the real world: (a) State spaces are high-dimensional, continuous, and partially observable; this implies that (b) data are relatively sparse and, indeed, precisely the same situation may never be encountered twice; furthermore, (c) rewards depend on the long-term consequences of actions in ways that violate the classical assumptions that make {RL} tractable. A seemingly distinct challenge is that, cognitively, theories of {RL} have largely involved procedural and semantic memory, the way in which knowledge about action values or world models extracted gradually from many experiences can drive choice. This focus on semantic memory leaves out many aspects of memory, such as episodic memory, related to the traces of individual events. We suggest that these two challenges are related. The computational challenge can be dealt with, in part, by endowing {RL} systems with episodic memory, allowing them to (a) efficiently approximate value functions over complex state spaces, (b) learn with very little data, and (c) bridge long-term dependencies between actions and rewards. We review the computational theory underlying this proposal and the empirical evidence to support it. Our proposal suggests that the ubiquitous and diverse roles of memory in {RL} may function as part of an integrated learning system.},

A particular strategy is proposed that involves a number of different techniques (electrophysiological recording, lesions, electrical stimulation, pathway tracing) to identify the essential memory trace circuit for a given form of learning and memory. The methods of reversible inactivation can be used to localize the memory traces within this circuit. Using classical conditioning of eye blink and other discrete responses as a model system, the essential memory trace circuit is identified, the basic memory trace is localized (to the cerebellum), and putative higher-order memory traces are characterized in the hippocampus.},

The approach taken provides insight into the neuronal operations that take place in each of these brain systems, and has the aim of leading to quantitative biologically plausible neuronal network models of how each of these memory systems actually operates.},

This autobiographical article provides a brief summary of the author's research investigating neurobiological systems responsible for the influence of emotional arousal on the consolidation of lasting memories. The research began with the finding that stimulant drugs enhanced memory in rats when administered shortly after training. Those findings suggested the possibility that endogenous systems activated by arousal might influence neural processes underlying memory consolidation. Subsequent findings that adrenal stress hormones activated by learning experiences enhance memory consolidation provided strong evidence supporting this hypothesis. Other findings suggest that the enhancement is induced by stress hormone activation of the amygdala. The findings also suggest that the basolateral amygdala modulates memory consolidation via its projections to brain regions involved in processing different aspects and forms of memory. This emotional-arousal-activated neurobiological system thus seems to play an important adaptive role in insuring that the strength of our memories will reflect their emotional significance.},

Here, we critically examine the major psychological theories (the “mind”) of short-term memory and how they relate to evidence about underlying brain mechanisms. We focus on three features that must be addressed by any satisfactory theory of short-term memory. First, we examine the evidence for the architecture of short-term memory, with special attention to questions of capacity and how—or whether—short-term memory can be separated from long-term memory. Second, we ask how the components of that architecture enact processes of encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Third, we describe the debate over the reason about forgetting from short-term memory, whether interference or decay is the cause. We close with a conceptual model tracing the representation of a single item through a short-term memory task, describing the biological mechanisms that might support psychological processes on a moment-by-moment basis as an item is encoded, maintained over a delay with some forgetting, and ultimately retrieved.},

In this review, we discuss how these methods can sensitively index neural representations of perceptual and semantic content and how leverage on the engagement of distributed representations provides unique insights into distinct aspects of memory-guided behavior. We emphasize that, in addition to characterizing the contents of memories, analyses of distributed patterns shed light on the processes that influence how information is encoded, maintained, or retrieved, and thus inform memory theory. We conclude by highlighting open questions about memory that can be addressed through distributed pattern analyses.},

However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call “moral contagion.” Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues (n = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20\% for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality. These findings offer insights into how people are exposed to moral and political ideas through social networks, thus expanding models of social influence and group polarization as people become increasingly immersed in social media networks.},

According to this theory, information is encoded in an all-or-none manner into cognitive units and the strength of these units increases with practice and decays with delay. The essential process to memory performance is the retrieval operation. It is proposed that the cognitive units form an interconnected network and that retrieval is performed by spreading activation throughout the network. Level of activation in the network determines rate and probability of recall. With these assumptions in place, the {ACT} theory is shown to predict interference results in memory, judgements of associative relatedness, impact of extensive practice on memory, the differences between recognition and recall, effects of elaborative processing, and effects of reconstructive recall.},

We next examine how conversational remembering affects subsequent memory. Here, we address influences on listeners' memory through social contagion, resistance to such influences, and then retrieval/reexposure effects on either speaker or listener, with a focus on retrieval-induced forgetting. Extending the perspective beyond single interactions, we consider work that has explored how the above effects can spread across networks of several individuals. We also explore how a speaker's motive to form a shared reality with listeners can moderate conversational effects on memory. Finally, we discuss how these various conversational effects may promote the formation of collective memories.},

Results showed a primarily positive effect of information sharing on {SNSs} on our relationships. Furthermore, relationship development mainly occurs among acquaintances and friends, and public posts are most strongly related to relationship development. These findings suggest that {SNSs} might affect relationships in a distinct fashion as acquaintances and friends gain access to public self-disclosures that might normally only be reserved for close friends and family. Overall, this study provides an insight into some of the positive aspects of the public nature of {SNSs} in contrast with the general negative associations.},

Respondents judged the content and relational effects of own and friends’ status updates as well as private conversations. In general, all types of messages were mainly positive and entertaining. The more intimate communication took place in private conversations; here, the classical link between disclosure intimacy and feeling connected still held. However, positive and entertaining self-disclosures also increased the feeling of connection, especially when reading friends’ updates. Interestingly, interaction partners’ responsiveness did not play a significant role, indicating that results from dyadic face-to-face interactions do not hold for public communication on social media.

A study was conducted in order to determine whether interactions between users via the application more successfully motivated physical activity than simply recording daily step counts in a similar application. Ten participants (1 male), all nurses working in a {UK} hospital, used the application across two conditions over the course of the study. In the socially-enabled condition, participants could view each other's step data and make comparisons and comments. In the non-social condition, participants could only view their own personal step data. A significant increase in step activity was observed in the socially enabled condition.

They also suggest that simple mobile devices can function as an inexpensive, accessible and powerful trigger towards this behaviour change without necessitating the use of overly complex and expensive mobile applications or devices.},

Path analysis was employed to examine the research model. The use of {UGC} was motivated by needs for information, entertainment, personal identity, and social interaction. While personality did not predict users' motives, their attitudes towards advertising in general explained individual motivation patterns to a large extent. It was consequently proposed and confirmed that users' motives mediate the influence of recipients' general attitude toward advertising on {UGC} usage. Results indicated a strong effective potential for {UGC} in online advertising: users view such content expressly to be influenced by others fulfilling their needs for information, personal identity and social interaction.

	abstract = {The present research investigated whether the attribution process through which people explain self-disclosures differs in text-based computer-mediated interactions versus face to face, and whether differences in causal attributions account for the increased intimacy frequently observed in mediated communication. In the experiment participants were randomly assigned to a face-to-face or computer-mediated interaction with a confederate who made either high- or low-intimacy self-disclosures. Results indicated that computer-mediated interactions intensified the association between disclosure and intimacy relative to face-to-face interactions, and this intensification effect was fully mediated by increased interpersonal (relationship) attributions observed in the computer-mediated condition. The article presents an attributional extension of the hyperpersonal model (Walther, 1996) by demonstrating the role of causal attributions in interpersonal intensification processes in text-based computer-mediated interactions.},

Analyses show that thematic and executional characteristics varied both across and within ad sponsor, and that executional characteristics of “personal testimonial” and “visceral negative” clearly had the strongest and most consistent effect on appraisal, recall, and level of engagement. Antismoking advertisements are not alike in their ability to engage youth.

The Health Belief Model ({HBM}) was developed in 1966 to predict health-promoting behaviour and has been used in patients with wide variety of disease. The {HBM} has also been used to inform the development of interventions to improve health behaviours. Several reviews have documented the {HBM}'s performance in predicting behaviour, but no review has addressed its utility in the design of interventions or the efficacy of these interventions. A systematic review was conducted to identify interventional studies which use the {HBM} as the theoretical basis for intervention design. The {HBM} has been used continuously in the development of behaviour change interventions for 40 years. Of 18 eligible studies, 14 (78\%) reported significant improvements in adherence, with 7 (39\%) showing moderate to large effects. However, only six studies used the {HBM} in its entirety and five different studies measured health beliefs as outcomes. Intervention success appeared to be unrelated to {HBM} construct addressed challenging the utility of this model as the theoretical basis for adherence-enhancing interventions. Interventions need to be described in full to allow for the identification of effective components and replication of studies.},

	abstract = {Reaching the milestone figure of 500 million members in July 2010, the growth of the social networking site Facebook has rapidly accelerated. Currently, its membership figures would make it the third largest country in the world, suggesting that participation in online social networks has become more than a cursory phenomenon. Members of Facebook are required to create an individualized online profile that provides information about themselves, their physical appearance, individual tastes, and preferences (see Liu 2007; Liu et al. 2006), and that highlights certain aspects of their own personality. By means of these features, users inevitably construct and manage impressions of their self. Research has already shown that such a personal webpage even allows a more detailed self-presentation than a casual face-to-face interaction and that people indeed make use of it in order to emphasize certain aspects of their “true” self (Bargh et al. 2002; Haferkamp and Krämer 2010). Additionally, empirical findings indicate that social networking sites ({SNSs}) are not only a potential means for self-presentation but that people are indeed highly motivated to use this new arena for presenting themselves (Haferkamp and Krämer 2010). In doing this, they even adopt profile elements that have originally been provided for other purposes (e.g., people become a member of a group in order to display their attitudes and interests instead of in order to communicate with others, Haferkamp and Krämer 2009). This tendency might be due to the fundamental motive of every human being to present him/herself in a positive way and, in doing so, gain positive reactions from those forming an impression (Leary 1995; Leary and Kowalski 1990).},

However, this existing work neglects to address differences in the ‘value’ (social/economic) of the audience. Through the lens of self-presentation theory, we argue that it is not the strictest audience that constrains behavior but the strongest (i.e. that which has the highest score for standards and value combined). We call this the strongest audience effect ({SAE}). The aim of this research is to examine and contrast the {LCDE} and {SAE}. A survey of young Facebook users (n = 379) provides support for the {SAE} when compared to {LCDE}, with the strength of the strongest audience predicting behavioral constraint and also social anxiety. Additional insights are generated into which audiences are perceived as the strongest. This study contributes a novel and more holistic lens to understand self-presentation in the presence of multiple audiences in social network sites.},

Using a uses and gratifications approach, we address this problem by reconceptualizing {SNSs} as collections of features. Survey data collected from undergraduate students at a large Midwestern university (n=267) revealed that users’ motivations for using Facebook predict their use of different features, such as status updates and Wall posts, but features that share similar capabilities do not necessarily share underlying motivations for use. When these results are contrasted against models employing a more unidimensional measure of Facebook use, we find differences between motivations for both general Facebook use and use of specific features of the site. This suggests that unidimensional measures of {SNS} use obfuscate motivations for using specific features. Theoretical and methodological implications of these findings and this approach are discussed.},

How do these features enable and constrain the sculpting of personal and professional persona? And what are the consequences of imposed connectivity and narrative uniformity on people’s online identities?},

These campaigns can be used to catalyze wider political engagement on the issue and to promote sustainable consumer choices and behaviors. From past research, we outline six relevant categories of self-designated opinion-leaders, detailing issues related to identification, recruitment, training, message development, and coordination. We additionally analyze as prominent initiatives Al Gore’s The Climate Project and his more recent We campaign, which combines the recruitment of digital opinion-leaders with traditional media strategies. In evaluating digital opinion-leader campaigns, we conclude that there are likely to be significant trade-offs in comparison to face-to-face initiatives. The challenge for both scholars and practitioners is to understand under what conditions are digital opinion-leaders effective and in which ways can online interactions strengthen or build on real-world connections.},

Analyses collapsing across different types of shifting gave more consistent results overall than analysis within individual types, suggesting a commonality across types of shifting. These areas shared substantial, significant overlap with regions derived from kernel-based analyses of reported peaks for executive processes in working memory ({WM}). The results suggest that there is a common set of brain regions active in diverse executive control operations, including medial prefrontal, superior and inferior parietal, medial parietal, and premotor cortices. However, within several of these regions, different types of switching produced spatially discriminable activation foci. Precise locations of meta analysis-derived regions from both attention shifting and working memory are defined electronically and may be used as regions of interest in future studies.},

	abstract = {What makes health news articles attractable and viral? Why do some articles diffuse widely by prompting audience selections (attractability) and subsequent social retransmissions (virality), while others do not? Identifying what drives social epidemics of health news coverage is crucial to our understanding of its impact on the public, especially in the emerging media environment where news consumption has become increasingly selective and social. This dissertation examines how message features and social influence affect the volume and persistence of attractability and virality within the context of the online diffusion of New York Times ({NYT}) health news articles. The dissertation analyzes (1) behavioral data of audience selections and retransmissions of the {NYT} articles and (2) associated article content and context data that are collected using computational social science approaches (automated data mining; computer-assisted content analysis) along with more traditional methods (manual content analysis; message evaluation survey). Analyses of message effects on the total volume of attractability and virality show that articles with high informational utility and positive sentiment invite more frequent selections and retransmissions, and that articles are also more attractable when presenting controversial, emotionally evocative, and familiar content. Furthermore, these analyses reveal that informational utility and novelty have stronger positive associations with email-specific virality, while emotion-related message features, content familiarity, and exemplification play a larger role in triggering social media-based retransmissions. Temporal dynamics analyses demonstrate social influence-driven cumulative advantage effects, such that articles which stay on popular-news lists longer invite more frequent subsequent selections and retransmissions. These analyses further show that the social influence effects are stronger for articles containing message features found to enhance the total volume of attractability and virality. This suggests that those synergistic interactions might underlie the observed message effects on total selections and retransmissions. Exploratory analyses reveal that the effects of social influence and message features tend to be similar for both (1) the volume of audience news selections and retransmissions and (2) the persistence of those behaviors. However, some message features, such as expressed emotionality, are relatively unique predictors of persistence outcomes. Results are discussed in light of their implications for communication research and practice.},

Self-projection and the brain. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11, 49–57, 2007]. This purported network—medial prefrontal, medial-temporal, and medial and lateral parietal regions—is similar to that observed during default-mode processing and has been argued to represent self-projection [Buckner, R. L., \& Carroll, D. C. Self-projection and the brain. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11, 49–57, 2007] or scene-construction [Hassabis, D., \& Maguire, E. A. Deconstructing episodic memory with construction. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11, 299–306, 2007]. To date, no systematic and quantitative demonstration of evidence for this common network has been presented. Using the activation likelihood estimation ({ALE}) approach, we conducted four separate quantitative meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies on: (a) autobiographical memory, (b) navigation, (c) theory of mind, and (d) default mode. A conjunction analysis between these domains demonstrated a high degree of correspondence. We compared these findings to a separate {ALE} analysis of prospection studies and found additional correspondence. Across all domains, and consistent with the proposed network, correspondence was found within the medial-temporal lobe, precuneus, posterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex, and the temporo-parietal junction. Additionally, this study revealed that the core network extends to lateral prefrontal and occipital cortices. Autobiographical memory, prospection, theory of mind, and default mode demonstrated further reliable involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex and lateral temporal cortices. Autobiographical memory and theory of mind, previously studied as distinct, exhibited extensive functional overlap. These findings represent quantitative evidence for a core network underlying a variety of cognitive domains.},

Second, we need to understand the ways in which human brains differ from the brains of our closest living relatives. Third, clues from the fossil record may allow us to outline the manner in which these differences evolved. Finally, studies of brain structure/function relationships are critical for us to make behavioral sense of the evolutionary changes that occurred.

More importantly, the findings provided support for self-efficacy expectancy as a fourth component of protection motivation theory: Self-efficacy had a direct influence on intentions and interacted with two other variables of protection motivation theory. The interaction effect was interpreted in terms of two new decision-making strategies that people use when confronted with a fear appeal: a precaution strategy and a hyperdefensiveness strategy. In addition, the results replicated previous findings on the relationship between self-efficacy expectancy and outcome expectancy. A model incorporating protection motivation theory and self-efficacy theory is presented as a possible general model of attitude change.},

	abstract = {This is the classic work upon which modern-day game theory is based. What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences. This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the New York Times, tthe American Economic Review, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.},

The ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({vMPFC}) is involved in self-related processing, and disrupted {vMPFC} activity is associated with disruptions of emotional/social functioning (e.g. depression and autism). Clarifying precise function(s) of {vMPFC} in self-related processing is an area of active investigation. In this study, we sought to more specifically characterize the function of {vMPFC} in self-related processing, focusing on two alternative accounts: (i) assignment of positive subjective value to self-related information and (ii) assignment of personal significance to self-related information. During functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), participants imagined owning objects associated with either their perceived ingroup or outgroup. We found that for ingroup-associated objects, {vMPFC} showed greater activity for objects with increased than decreased post-ownership preference. In contrast, for outgroup-associated objects, {vMPFC} showed greater activity for objects with decreased than increased post-ownership preference. Our findings support the idea that the function of {vMPFC} in self-related processing may not be to represent/evaluate the ‘positivity’ or absolute preference of self-related information but to assign personal significance to it based on its meaning/function for the self.},

We find that the level of inter-subject correlation in the evoked encephalographic responses predicts the expressions of interest and preference among thousands. Surprisingly, ratings of the larger audience are predicted with greater accuracy than those of the individuals from whom the neural data is obtained. An additional functional magnetic resonance imaging study employing a separate sample of subjects shows that the level of neural reliability evoked by these stimuli covaries with the amount of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent ({BOLD}) activation in higher-order visual and auditory regions. Our findings suggest that stimuli which we judge favourably may be those to which our brains respond in a stereotypical manner shared by our peers.},

The theory of planned behavior constructs accounted for 31\% of exercise behavior and 43\% of exercise intention. Intention and perceived behavioral control were significant predictors of exercise behavior. Although the descriptive norm did not augment the theory of planned behavior, all original constructs--attitude, injunctive norm (a narrow definition of subjective norm), and perceived behavioral control--statistically significantly predicted leisure-time physical activity intention.

To examine the diffusion of an evidence-based smoking cessation application (“app”) through Facebook social networks and identify specific intervention components that accelerate diffusion.Methods. Between December 2012 and October 2013, we recruited adult {US} smokers (“seeds”) via Facebook advertising and randomized them to 1 of 12 app variants using a factorial design. App variants targeted components of diffusion: duration of use (t), “contagiousness” (β), and number of contacts (Z). The primary outcome was the reproductive ratio (R), defined as the number of individuals installing the app (“descendants”) divided by the number of a seed participant’s Facebook friends.Results. We randomized 9042 smokers. App utilization metrics demonstrated between-variant differences in expected directions. The highest level of diffusion (R = 0.087) occurred when we combined active contagion strategies with strategies to increase duration of use (incidence rate ratio = 9.99; 95\% confidence interval = 5.58, 17.91; P {\textless} .001). Involving nonsmokers did not affect diffusion.Conclusions. The maximal R value (0.087) is sufficient to increase the numbers of individuals receiving treatment if applied on a large scale.

	abstract = {Context: Spousal communication and family planning use are closely linked, but the pathways of influence, especially within the context of exposure to a mass media campaign promoting family planning, are unclear. Methods: Panel data from a population-based survey in Nepal were collected over three waves, from 1994 to 1999, to evaluate the impact of a radio drama serial among couples of reproductive age. Data from 1,442 women were used to assess changes in couples' family planning decision-making, identify predictors of spousal communication and family planning use in relation to program exposure, and clarify temporal relationships among these variables. Results: Women exposed to the program had significantly elevated odds of believing that their spouse approved of family planning and of having discussed family planning with their spouse (odds ratios, 1.8-1.9). Those who communicated with their spouse had elevated odds of using family planning (10.2). Spousal communication at baseline was associated with subsequent family planning use, independent of campaign exposure. In addition, among couples who had not already been discussing family planning, exposure led to communication, which in turn led to family planning use. Over time, husbands' dominance in making family planning decisions gave way to joint decision-making and an increase in women's decision-making power. Conclusions: New indicators are needed to capture campaign effects on individuals who are predisposed to use family planning. Couples' joint decision-making should be promoted as a strategy for increasing family planning use. Interventions are needed to improve women's autonomy and strengthen their negotiating capacity for family planning use.},

However, these early studies were characterized by small sample sizes. Our statistical multi-level kernel density analysis ({MKDA}) of Cyberball neuroimaging studies with 244 participants fails to support the claim that social rejection operates on the same pain matrix as nociceptive stimuli, questioning whether social pain is more figurative or literal. We also performed an {MKDA} of the neuroimaging studies of reliving a romantic rejection to test whether the pain matrix was activated if the rejection were more meaningful. Results again failed to support the notion that rejection activates the neural matrix identified in studies of physical pain. Reliving an unwanted rejection by a romantic partner was significantly characterized by activation within and beyond the “Cyberball” brain network, suggesting that the neural correlates of social pain are more complex than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Objective: Anti-smoking {PSAs} are not always effective in reducing cigarette smoking, and there is a lack of research into mechanisms through which {PSAs} affect the attitudes and behaviors of viewers. The present research was designed to better understand how smokers and non-smokers process anti-smoking ads. Design: In a repeated measures design, the accessibility of smokers' (N = 70) and non-smokers' (N = 96) attitudes toward and norms concerning smoking were assessed and then their reactions to four anti-smoking {PSAs} were measured. Results: The accessibility of smokers' attitudes toward smoking--how quickly they bring their attitudes to mind--predicted their central processing of ad content, and smokers who counterargued in response to the ads were not persuaded by them. The accessibility of smokers' norms for smoking--how quickly they bring to mind social support for smoking--predicted their peripheral processing of the ads, and imbued resistance to persuasion. In contrast, non-smokers' attitude and norm accessibility were unrelated to ad processing. Conclusion: These results suggest that anti-smoking ads may have paradoxical effects on smokers and may actually undermine anti-smoking efforts. Furthermore, smokers who can readily access a pro-smoking norm are unlikely to process anti-smoking messages, which may further hinder anti-smoking efforts.},

	abstract = {Reviews evidence which suggests that there may be little or no direct introspective access to higher order cognitive processes. Ss are sometimes (a) unaware of the existence of a stimulus that importantly influenced a response, (b) unaware of the existence of the response, and (c) unaware that the stimulus has affected the response. It is proposed that when people attempt to report on their cognitive processes, that is, on the processes mediating the effects of a stimulus on a response, they do not do so on the basis of any true introspection. Instead, their reports are based on a priori, implicit causal theories, or judgments about the extent to which a particular stimulus is a plausible cause of a given response. This suggests that though people may not be able to observe directly their cognitive processes, they will sometimes be able to report accurately about them. Accurate reports will occur when influential stimuli are salient and are plausible causes of the responses they produce, and will not occur when stimuli are not salient or are not plausible causes.

For example, increasing physical activity among sedentary individuals affects a wide range of important mental and physical health outcomes, but has proven a challenging task. Affirming core values (i.e., self-affirmation) before message exposure is a psychological technique that can increase the effectiveness of a wide range of interventions in health and other domains; however, the neural mechanisms of affirmation’s effects have not been studied. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to examine neural processes associated with affirmation effects during exposure to potentially threatening health messages. We focused on an a priori defined region of interest ({ROI}) in ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({VMPFC}), a brain region selected for its association with self-related processing and positive valuation. Consistent with our hypotheses, those in the self-affirmation condition produced more activity in {VMPFC} during exposure to health messages and went on to increase their objectively measured activity levels more. These findings suggest that affirmation of core values may exert its effects by allowing at-risk individuals to see the self-relevance and value in otherwise-threatening messages.},

We scanned message communicators using functional {MRI} during their initial exposure to the to-be-communicated ideas. These message communicators then had the opportunity to spread the messages and their corresponding subjective evaluations to message recipients outside the scanner. Successful ideas were associated with neural responses in the communicators’ mentalizing systems and reward systems when they first heard the messages, prior to spreading them. Similarly, individuals more able to spread their own views to others produced greater mentalizing-system activity during initial encoding. Unlike prior social-influence studies that focused on the individuals being influenced, this investigation focused on the brains of influencers. Successful social influence is reliably associated with an influencer-to-be’s state of mind when first encoding ideas.},

Study 2 demonstrated that socioeconomic status, an objective indicator of global standing, predicted adolescents' neural activity during the processing of threatening faces, with individuals lower in social status displaying greater activity in the {DMPFC}, previously associated with mentalizing, and the amygdala, previously associated with emotion/salience processing.

However, no study has identified the neural systems of everyday self-control during long-term goal pursuit. The present study integrated neuroimaging and experience-sampling methods to investigate the brain systems of successful self-control among smokers attempting to quit. A sample of 27 cigarette smokers completed a go/no-go task during functional magnetic resonance imaging before they attempted to quit smoking and then reported everyday self-control using experience sampling eight times daily for 3 weeks while they attempted to quit. Increased activation in right inferior frontal gyrus, pre-supplementary motor area, and basal ganglia regions of interest during response inhibition at baseline was associated with an attenuated association between cravings and subsequent smoking. These findings support the ecological validity of neurocognitive tasks as indices of everyday response inhibition.},

	abstract = {Visual depictions of vaping in electronic cigarette advertisements may serve as smoking cues to smokers and former smokers, increasing urge to smoke and smoking behavior, and decreasing self-efficacy, attitudes, and intentions to quit or abstain. After assessing baseline urge to smoke, 301 daily smokers, 272 intermittent smokers, and 311 former smokers were randomly assigned to view three e-cigarette commercials with vaping visuals (the cue condition) or without vaping visuals (the no-cue condition), or to answer unrelated media use questions (the no-ad condition). Participants then answered a posttest questionnaire assessing the outcome variables of interest. Relative to other conditions, in the cue condition, daily smokers reported greater urge to smoke a tobacco cigarette and a marginally significantly greater incidence of actually smoking a tobacco cigarette during the experiment. Former smokers in the cue condition reported lower intentions to abstain from smoking than former smokers in other conditions. No significant differences emerged among intermittent smokers across conditions. These data suggest that visual depictions of vaping in e-cigarette commercials increase daily smokers’ urge to smoke cigarettes and may lead to more actual smoking behavior. For former smokers, these cues in advertising may undermine abstinence efforts. Intermittent smokers did not appear to be reactive to these cues. A lack of significant differences between participants in the no-cue and no-ad conditions compared to the cue condition suggests that visual depictions of e-cigarettes and vaping function as smoking cues, and cue reactivity is the mechanism through which these effects were obtained.},

Here we argue for broadening our understanding of deception by examining it as a dyadic and interactive event. Assumptions of an interpersonal perspective, articulated in Interpersonal Deception Theory, are advanced. These include recognizing the agency of both parties to interpersonal exchanges, examining such exchanges at multiple levels, incorporating measures of communicationrelated perceptions and interpretations as well as behaviors, recognizing that behaviors may be strategic as well as nonstrategic, and viewing such behavior as dynamic rather than static. An experiment reflecting this orientation is presented in which pairs of participants, half friends and half strangers, conducted interviews during which interviewees ({EEs}) either lied or told the truth to interviewers ({ERs}) who were induced to be highly, moderately, or not suspicious. Dependent measures included participant ({EE} and {ER}) perceptions, interpretations, and evaluations of {EE} behaviors and trained coders' ratings of actual nonverbal behaviors. Consistent with the theory, deceivers were more uncertain and vague, more nonimmediate and reticent, showed more negative affect, displayed more arousal and non-composure, and generally made a poorer impression than truthtellers. Their behaviors also connoted greater formality and submissiveness. Also consistent with the theory's premise that deceptive interactions are dynamic, deceivers' kinesic relaxation and pleasantness changed over time, in line with a behavior and image management interpretation, and degree of reciprocity between {EE} and {ER} nonverbal behaviors was affected by the presence of deception and suspicion.},

Matching negative behavior and not matching positive behavior carries the opposite connotative meaning. These predictions were partially supported. Although the interaction of adaptation and the valence of the stimulus behavior affected the students' encoded meanings of connectedness, it did not influence the extent to which receivers actually felt more connected to senders. This finding suggests the importance of examining multiple perspectives in interaction research rather than presuming that any 1 perspective accurately characterizes the dyad or group.},

	abstract = {The study of interpersonal synchrony examines how interacting individuals grow to have similar behavior, cognition, and emotion in time. Many of the established methods of analyzing interpersonal synchrony are costly and time-consuming; the study of bodily synchrony has been especially laborious, traditionally requiring researchers to hand-code movement frame by frame. Because of this, researchers have been searching for more efficient alternatives for decades. Recently, some researchers (e.g., Nagaoka \& Komori ({IEICE} Transactions on Information and Systems, 91(6), 1634–1640, 2008); Ramseyer \& Tschacher, 2008) have applied computer science and computer vision techniques to create frame-differencing methods ({FDMs}) to simplify analyses. In this article, we provide a detailed presentation of one such {FDM}, created by modifying and adding to existing {FDMs}. The {FDM} that we present requires little programming experience or specialized equipment: Only a few lines of {MATLAB} code are required to execute an automated analysis of interpersonal synchrony. We provide sample code and demonstrate its use with an analysis of brief, friendly conversations; using linear mixed-effects models, the measure of interpersonal synchrony was found to be significantly predicted by time lag (p {\textless} .001) and by the interaction between time lag and measures of interpersonal liking (p {\textless} .001). This pattern of results fits with existing literature on synchrony. We discuss the current limitations and future directions for {FDMs}, including their use as part of a larger methodology for capturing and analyzing multimodal interaction.},

	abstract = {Information sharing is an integral part of human interaction that serves to build social relationships and affects attitudes and behaviors in individuals and large groups. We present a unifying neurocognitive framework of mechanisms underlying information sharing at scale (virality). We argue that expectations regarding self-related and social consequences of sharing (e.g., in the form of potential for self-enhancement or social approval) are integrated into a domain-general value signal that encodes the value of sharing a piece of information. This value signal translates into population-level virality. In two studies (n = 41 and 39 participants), we tested these hypotheses using functional neuroimaging. Neural activity in response to 80 New York Times articles was observed in theory-driven regions of interest associated with value, self, and social cognitions. This activity then was linked to objectively logged population-level data encompassing n = 117,611 internet shares of the articles. In both studies, activity in neural regions associated with self-related and social cognition was indirectly related to population-level sharing through increased neural activation in the brain's value system. Neural activity further predicted population-level outcomes over and above the variance explained by article characteristics and commonly used self-report measures of sharing intentions. This parsimonious framework may help advance theory, improve predictive models, and inform new approaches to effective intervention. More broadly, these data shed light on the core functions of sharing—to express ourselves in positive ways and to strengthen our social bonds.},

The ideomotor framework of human actions assumes a common representational format for action and perception that facilitates imitation. Furthermore, the associative sequence learning model of imitation proposes that experience-based Hebbian learning forms links between sensory processing of the actions of others and motor plans. Social psychology studies have demonstrated that imitation and mimicry are pervasive, automatic, and facilitate empathy. Neuroscience investigations have demonstrated physiological mechanisms of mirroring at single-cell and neural-system levels that support the cognitive and social psychology constructs. Why were these neural mechanisms selected, and what is their adaptive advantage? Neural mirroring solves the “problem of other minds” (how we can access and understand the minds of others) and makes intersubjectivity possible, thus facilitating social behavior.},

Following a baseline interview administered by the information specialist, subjects were randomly assigned to one of four conditions, each delivered by U.S. mail: a single, untailored smoking cessation guide ({SU}); a single, tailored smoking cessation guide ({ST}); a series of four (multiple) printed materials tailored only to baseline data ({MT}); and a series of four (multiple) printed materials tailored to baseline as well as retailored using 5-month interim progress data ({MRT}). The primary outcome measure was 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates assessed using a computer-assisted telephone interview ({CATI}) at 12-month follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, using intent-to-treat, imputed, and per-protocol analyses, no differences were found among the four experimental conditions (linear trend), or when the {ST}, {MT}, and {MRT} groups were compared with the control ({SU}) group. Participants in the two multiple message group conditions combined ({MT} + {MRT}), however, had significantly higher abstinence rates than participants in the two single message group conditions combined ({SU} + {ST}). Moreover, among subjects who reported quitting at the 5-month follow-up, participants receiving the {MRT} materials reported higher abstinence rates at 12 months than the other three groups combined ({SU} + {ST} + {MT}). The results of this study support the effectiveness, over and above a single telecounseling interaction, of multiple tailored print material contacts on cessation. These effects, however may be due to tailoring, or the longitudinal nature of the two multiple tailored conditions, or both. The strongest evidence for tailoring occurred in the {MRT} condition for relapse prevention, suggesting that print materials tailored to interim progress may be especially effective in this context. The qualities of specific psychosocial and communication elements in tailored materials should receive attention in future research.},

For {LI} Ss, opinion change was significantly greater given a likable communicator but was unaffected by the argument's manipulation. In Exp {II} with 80 similar Ss, {HI} Ss showed slightly greater opinion change when exposed to 5 arguments from an unlikable (vs 1 argument from a likable) communicator, whereas {LI} Ss exhibited significantly greater persuasion in response to 1 argument from a likable (vs 5 arguments from an unlikable) communicator. Findings support the idea that {HI} leads message recipients to employ a systematic information processing strategy in which message-based cognitions mediate persuasion, whereas {LI} leads recipients to use a heuristic processing strategy in which simple decision rules mediate persuasion.

	abstract = {The ability to infer value from the reactions of other people is a common and essential ability with a poorly understood neurobiology. Commonly, social learning matches one's values and behavior to what is perceived as normal for one's social group. This is known as conformity. Conformity of value correlates with neural activity shared by cognitions that depend on optimum catecholamine levels, but catecholamine involvement in conformity has not been tested empirically. Methylphenidate ({MPH}) is an indirect dopamine and noradrenalin agonist, commonly used for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder for which it reduces undesirable behavior as evaluated by peers and authority figures, indicative of increased conformity. We hypothesized that {MPH} might increase conformity of value. In all, 38 healthy adult females received either a single oral 20 mg dose of {MPH} or placebo ({PL}). Each subject rated 153 faces for trustworthiness followed immediately by the face's mean rating from a group of peers. After 30 min and a 2-back continuous-performance working-memory task, subjects were unexpectedly asked to rate all the faces again. Both the groups tended to change their ratings towards the social norm. The {MPH} group exhibited twice the conformity effect of the {PL} group following moderate social conflict, but this did not occur following large conflicts. This suggests that {MPH} might enhance signals that would otherwise be too weak to evoke conformity. {MPH} did not affect 2-back performance. We provide a new working hypothesis of a neurocognitive mechanism by which {MPH} reduces socially disruptive behavior and provides novel evidence of catecholamine mediation of social learning.},

The results show that {EEG} measures (beta and gamma oscillations), beyond stated preference measures, provide unique information regarding individual and population-wide preference and can thus, in principle, be used as a neural marker for commercial success. As such, these results provide the first evidence that {EEG} measures are related to real-world outcomes and that these neural measures can significantly add to models predicting choice behavior relative to models that include only stated preference measures.},

However, the value of these methods in predicting advertising success remains underresearched. Using a unique experimental protocol to assess responses to 30-second television ads, the authors capture many measures of advertising effectiveness across six commonly used methods (traditional self-reports, implicit measures, eye tracking, biometrics, electroencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging). These measures have been shown to reliably tap into higher-level constructs commonly used in advertising research: attention, affect, memory, and desirability. Using time-series data on sales and gross rating points, the authors attempt to relate individual-level response to television ads in the lab to the ads' aggregate, market-level elasticities. The authors show that functional magnetic resonance imaging measures explain the most variance in advertising elasticities beyond the baseline traditional measures. Notably, activity in the ventral striatum is the strongest predictor of real-world, market-level response to advertising. The authors discuss the findings and their significant implications for theory, research, and practice.},

The present research offers a theoretical perspective that provides a means to resolve these seemingly contradictory findings. Specifically, the authors compare the generation of {WOM} (i.e., consumers sharing information about their own experiences) with the transmission of {WOM} (i.e., consumers passing on information about experiences they heard occurred to others). They suggest that a basic human motive to self-enhance leads consumers to generate positive {WOM} (i.e., share information about their own positive consumption experiences) but transmit negative {WOM} (i.e., pass on information they heard about others' negative consumption experiences). The authors present evidence for self-enhancement motives playing out in opposite ways for {WOM} generation versus {WOM} transmission across four experiments.},

	abstract = {One of the most recent influential trends in the global environment has been the rise of social media. Stakeholders have found a strong voice in social media, and messages are spread among social media users at an astounding speed across a global landscape. As a result of this phenomenon and in an effort to use this viral spread of messages across social media, companies are increasingly making use of viral marketing. Viral messages are playing an increasingly important role in influencing and shifting public opinion on corporate reputations, brands, and products as well as political parties and public personalities to name but a few. Very little is known about the motivations, attitudes, and behavior of the people who forward viral messages to their online networks. Through in-depth interviews with college-going Generation Y consumers, we explore this relationship between viral media and emotions. We look at two very specific components of online videos that have gone viral: first, the relevance of the video's content and, second, participants' emotional reaction to these videos to try and better explain the viral spread of online video messages. The paper concludes by proposing a decision tree that interusers might subconsciously experience when deciding whether to share a video with their friends or not. The article concludes with a discussion about future research avenues in the area of emotions and viral marketing. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We provide a critical review of the research, noting potential problems and issues that warrant attention to move the field forward. Among the recommendations are greater integration of neuroimaging approaches with existing behavioral theories and methods on the information processes (cognitive and affective) underlying persuasion, and moving beyond solely correlative approaches for specifying underlying neural mechanisms.

Our random effects model indicated that synchronous actions affected all four dimensions of response. Synchrony had a medium-sized positive effect on prosocial behaviors, a small-to-medium-sized positive effect on both perceived social bonding and social cognition, and a small-sized positive effect on positive affect. Notably, synchrony in larger groups increased prosocial behavior and positive affect, but group size did not moderate the relationship between synchrony and perceived social bonding and social cognition.

We review evidence for this taxonomy, with emphasis on negativity dominance, including literary, historical, religious, and cultural sources, as well as the psychological literatures on learning, attention, impression formation, contagion, moral judgment, development, and memory. We then consider a variety of theoretical accounts for negativity bias.

	abstract = {Interpersonal synchrony is characterized by a temporary alignment of periodic behaviors with another person. This process requires that at least one of the two individuals monitors and adjusts his/her movements to maintain alignment with the other individual (the referent). Interestingly, recent research on interpersonal synchrony has found that people who are motivated to befriend an unfamiliar social referent tend to automatically synchronize with their social referents, raising the possibility that synchrony may be employed as an affiliation tool. It is unknown, however, whether the opposite is true; that is, whether the person serving as the referent of interpersonal synchrony perceives synchrony with his/her partner or experiences affiliative feelings toward the partner.
To address this question, we performed a series of studies on interpersonal synchrony with a total of 100 participants. In all studies, participants served as the referent with no requirement to monitor or align their behavior with their partners. Unbeknown to the participants, the timings of their “partner’s” movements were actually determined by a computer program based on the participant’s (i.e., referent’s) behavior.
Overall, our behavioral results showed that the referent of a synchrony task expressed greater perceived synchrony and greater social affiliation toward a synchronous partner (i.e., one displaying low mean asynchrony and/or a narrow asynchrony range) than with an asynchronous partner (i.e., one displaying high mean asynchrony and/or high asynchrony range). Our neuroimaging study extended these results by demonstrating involvement of brain areas implicated in social cognition, embodied cognition, self-other expansion, and action observation as correlates of interpersonal synchrony (vs. asynchrony). These findings have practical implications for social interaction and theoretical implications for understanding interpersonal synchrony and social coordination.},

The ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens ({VS}/Nacc), in particular, has been implicated in the reward component of social motivation, i.e., the ‘wanting’ of social incentives like approval. However, it is unclear to what extent the {VS}/Nacc is involved in avoiding social punishment like disapproval, an intrinsically pleasant outcome. Thus, we conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) study using a social incentive delay task with dynamic video stimuli instead of static pictures as social incentives in order to examine participants’ motivation for social reward gain and social punishment avoidance. As predicted, the anticipation of avoidable social punishment (i.e., disapproval) recruited the {VS}/Nacc in a manner that was similar to {VS}/Nacc activation observed during the anticipation of social reward gain (i.e., approval). Stronger {VS}/Nacc activity was accompanied by faster reaction times of the participants to obtain those desired outcomes. This data support the assumption that dynamic social incentives elicit robust {VS}/Nacc activity, which likely reflects motivation to obtain social reward and to avoid social punishment. Clinical implications regarding the involvement of the {VS}/Nacc in social motivation dysfunction in autism and social phobia are discussed.},

Despite an increasing focus on the neural basis of human decision making in neuroscience, relatively little attention has been paid to decision making in social settings. Moreover, although human social decision making has been explored in a social psychology context, few neural explanations for the observed findings have been considered. To bridge this gap and improve models of human social decision making, we investigated whether acquiring a good reputation, which is an important incentive in human social behaviors, activates the same reward circuitry as monetary rewards. In total, 19 subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) experiments involving monetary and social rewards. The acquisition of one's good reputation robustly activated reward-related brain areas, notably the striatum, and these overlapped with the areas activated by monetary rewards. Our findings support the idea of a “common neural currency” for rewards and represent an important first step toward a neural explanation for complex human social behaviors.},

Although social play is very pleasurable, it is more than just a frivolous activity: it is crucial for the development of behavioral flexibility, the acquisition of social and cognitive competence, and the maintenance of group cohesion. Social play is a natural reinforcer, and the neurotransmitter systems intimately implicated in the motivational, pleasurable and cognitive aspects of natural and drug rewards, such as opioids, endocannabinoids, dopamine and norepinephrine, play an important modulatory role in the performance of social play. In this review, we address the notion that social play is rewarding, and discuss recent developments in the neuropharmacology of this behavior.

Focusing largely on recent advances in the human neuroimaging literature, we review findings highlighting the neural circuitry and processes that underlie pursuit of valued rewarding outcomes across non-social and social domains.

	abstract = {While the human medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}) is widely believed to be a key node of neural networks relevant for socio-emotional processing, its functional subspecialization is still poorly understood. We thus revisited the often assumed differentiation of the {mPFC} in social cognition along its ventral-dorsal axis. Our neuroinformatic analysis was based on a neuroimaging meta-analysis of perspective-taking that yielded two separate clusters in the ventral and dorsal {mPFC}, respectively. We determined each seed region’s brain-wide interaction pattern by two complementary measures of functional connectivity: co-activation across a wide range of neuroimaging studies archived in the {BrainMap} database and correlated signal fluctuations during unconstrained (“resting”) cognition. Furthermore, we characterized the functions associated with these two regions using the {BrainMap} database. Across methods, the ventral {mPFC} was more strongly connected with the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex, and retrosplenial cortex, while the dorsal {mPFC} was more strongly connected with the inferior frontal gyrus, temporo-parietal junction, and middle temporal gyrus. Further, the ventral {mPFC} was selectively associated with action execution, olfaction, and reward related tasks, while the dorsal {mPFC} was selectively associated with perspective-taking and episodic memory retrieval. The ventral {mPFC} is therefore predominantly involved in sensory-driven, approach/avoidance-modulating, and evaluation-related processing, whereas the dorsal {mPFC} is predominantly involved in internally driven, memory-informed, and metacognition-related processing in social cognition.},

This continuous mutual adaptation results in interactional synchrony to which both members contribute. Freely exchanging the role of imitator and model is a well-framed example of interactional synchrony resulting from a mutual behavioral negotiation. How the participants' brain activity underlies this process is currently a question that hyperscanning recordings allow us to explore. In particular, it remains largely unknown to what extent oscillatory synchronization could emerge between two brains during social interaction. To explore this issue, 18 participants paired as 9 dyads were recorded with dual-video and dual-{EEG} setups while they were engaged in spontaneous imitation of hand movements. We measured interactional synchrony and the turn-taking between model and imitator. We discovered by the use of nonlinear techniques that states of interactional synchrony correlate with the emergence of an interbrain synchronizing network in the alpha-mu band between the right centroparietal regions. These regions have been suggested to play a pivotal role in social interaction. Here, they acted symmetrically as key functional hubs in the interindividual brainweb. Additionally, neural synchronization became asymmetrical in the higher frequency bands possibly reflecting a top-down modulation of the roles of model and imitator in the ongoing interaction.},

Unfortunately, most previous work on the {RMSEA} and its confidence interval has focused on models with a large df. Building on the work of Chen et al. to examine the impact of small df on the {RMSEA}, we conducted a theoretical analysis and a Monte Carlo simulation using correctly specified models with varying df and sample size. The results of our investigation indicate that when the cutoff values are used to assess the fit of the properly specified models with small df and small sample size, the {RMSEA} too often falsely indicates a poor fitting model. We recommend not computing the {RMSEA} for small df models, especially those with small sample sizes, but rather estimating parameters that were not originally specified in the model.},

	abstract = {Mfost of social psychology's theories of the self fail to take into account the significance of social identification in the definition of self. Social identities are self-definitions that are more inclusive than the individuated self-concept of most American psychology. A model of optimal distinctiveness is proposed in which social identity is viewed as a reconciliation of opposing needs for assimilation and differentiation from others. According to this model, individuals avoid self-construals that are either too personalized or too inclusive and instead define themselves in terms of distinctive category memberships. Social identity and group loyalty are hypothesized to be strongest for those self-categorizations that simultaneously provide for a sense of belonging and a sense of distinctiveness. Results from an initial laboratory experiment support the prediction that depersonalization and group size interact as determinants of the strength of social identification.},

For a nominal familywise error rate of 5\%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference.

However, it is still unclear what the exact roles of these regions in mentalizing are. Here, we compare activity within, and functional connectivity between, the {VMPFC}, precuneus and {TPJ} during two different mentalizing tasks. Specifically, we examine whether inferring another person's emotion (“emotion mentalizing”) and inferring another person's intention (“intention mentalizing”) activate similar or distinct subregions within the {VMPFC}, precuneus and {TPJ}, and whether these different kinds of mentalizing are associated with different patterns of functional connectivity between these regions. Our results indicate that emotion mentalizing and intention mentalizing activate partly distinct subregions of the right and left {TPJ} that can be spatially separated across participants. These subregions also showed different patterns of functional connectivity with the {VMPFC}: a more anterior region of the right and left {TPJ}, which was more strongly activated during emotion mentalizing, showed stronger functional connectivity with the {VMPFC}, particularly during emotion mentalizing, than a more posterior region that was more strongly activated during intention mentalizing. Critically, this double dissociation became evident only when the fine-scale distribution of activity within activated regions was analysed, and despite the fact that there was also a significant overlap of activity during the two tasks. Our findings provide first evidence that different neural modules might have evolved within the {TPJ} that show distinct patterns of functional connectivity and might subserve slightly different subfunctions of mentalizing.},

	abstract = {We compared two tasks that are widely used in research on mentalizing—false belief stories and animations of rigid geometric shapes that depict social interactions—to investigate whether the neural systems that mediate the representation of others' mental states are consistent across these tasks. Whereas false belief stories activated primarily the anterior paracingulate cortex ({APC}), the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus ({PCC}/{PC}), and the temporo-parietal junction ({TPJ})—components of the distributed neural system for theory of mind ({ToM})—the social animations activated an extensive region along nearly the full extent of the superior temporal sulcus, including a locus in the posterior superior temporal sulcus ({pSTS}), as well as the frontal operculum and inferior parietal lobule ({IPL})—components of the distributed neural system for action understanding—and the fusiform gyrus. These results suggest that the representation of covert mental states that may predict behavior and the representation of intentions that are implied by perceived actions involve distinct neural systems. These results show that the {TPJ} and the {pSTS} play dissociable roles in mentalizing and are parts of different distributed neural systems. Because the social animations do not depict articulated body movements, these results also highlight that the perception of the kinematics of actions is not necessary to activate the mirror neuron system, suggesting that this system plays a general role in the representation of intentions and goals of actions. Furthermore, these results suggest that the fusiform gyrus plays a general role in the representation of visual stimuli that signify agency, independent of visual form.},

	abstract = {Objective To inform international research and policy, we conducted a meta-analysis of the experimental literature on pictorial cigarette pack warnings.
Data sources We systematically searched 7 computerised databases in April 2013 using several search terms. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles.
Study selection We included studies that used an experimental protocol to test cigarette pack warnings and reported data on both pictorial and text-only conditions. 37 studies with data on 48 independent samples (N=33 613) met criteria.
Data extraction and synthesis Two independent coders coded all study characteristics. Effect sizes were computed from data extracted from study reports and were combined using random effects meta-analytic procedures.
Results Pictorial warnings were more effective than text-only warnings for 12 of 17 effectiveness outcomes (all p{\textless}0.05). Relative to text-only warnings, pictorial warnings (1) attracted and held attention better; (2) garnered stronger cognitive and emotional reactions; (3) elicited more negative pack attitudes and negative smoking attitudes and (4) more effectively increased intentions to not start smoking and to quit smoking. Participants also perceived pictorial warnings as being more effective than text-only warnings across all 8 perceived effectiveness outcomes.
Conclusions The evidence from this international body of literature supports pictorial cigarette pack warnings as more effective than text-only warnings. Gaps in the literature include a lack of assessment of smoking behaviour and a dearth of theory-based research on how warnings exert their effects.},

	abstract = {Objective Countries around the world have increasingly adopted pictorial health warning labels ({HWLs}) for tobacco packages to warn consumers about smoking-related risks. Research on how pictorial {HWLs} work has primarily analysed self-reported responses to {HWLs}; studies at the neural level comparing the brain's response to different types of {HWLs} may provide an important complement to prior studies, especially if self-reported responses are systematically biased. In this study we characterise the brain's response to three types of pictorial {HWLs} for which prior self-report studies indicated different levels of efficacy.
Methods Current smokers rated pictorial {HWLs} and then observed the same {HWLs} during functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) scanning. Fifty 18–50-year-old current adult smokers who were free from neurological disorders were recruited from the general population and participated in the study. Demographics, smoking-related behaviours and self-reported ratings of pictorial {HWL} stimuli were obtained prior to scanning. Brain responses to {HWLs} were assessed using {fMRI}, focusing on a priori regions of interest.
Results Pictorial {HWL} stimuli elicited activation in a broad network of brain areas associated with visual processing and emotion. Participants who rated the stimuli as more emotionally arousing also showed greater neural responses at these sites.
Conclusions Self-reported ratings of pictorial {HWLs} are correlated with neural responses in brain areas associated with visual and emotional processing. Study results cross-validate self-reported ratings of pictorial {HWLs} and provide insights into how pictorial {HWLs} are processed.},

	abstract = {There is an ongoing public debate about the new graphic warning labels ({GWLs}) that the Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) proposes to place on cigarette packs. Tobacco companies argued that the strongly emotional images {FDA} proposed to include in the {GWLs} encroached on their constitutional rights. The court ruled that {FDA} did not provide sufficient scientific evidence of compelling public interest in such encroachment. This study's objectives were to examine the effects of the {GWLs} on the electrophysiological and behavioral correlates of smoking addiction and to determine whether labels rated higher on the emotional reaction ({ER}) scale are associated with greater effects. We studied 25 non-treatment-seeking smokers. Event-related potentials ({ERPs}) were recorded while participants viewed a random sequence of paired images, in which visual smoking (Cues) or non-smoking (non-Cues) images were preceded by {GWLs} or neutral images. Participants reported their cigarette craving after viewing each pair. Dependent variables were magnitude of P300 {ERPs} and self-reported cigarette craving in response to Cues. We found that subjective craving response to Cues was significantly reduced by preceding {GWLs}, whereas the P300 amplitude response to Cues was reduced only by preceding {GWLs} rated high on the {ER} scale. In conclusion, our study provides experimental neuroscience evidence that weighs in on the ongoing public and legal debate about how to balance the constitutional and public health aspects of the {FDA}-proposed {GWLs}. The high toll of smoking-related illness and death adds urgency to the debate and prompts consideration of our findings while longitudinal studies of {GWLs} are underway.},

	abstract = {Background Warning labels on cigarette packages are an important venue for information about the hazards of smoking. The 2009 {US} Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act mandated replacing the current text-only labels with graphic warning labels. However, labels proposed by the Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) were challenged in court by the tobacco companies, who argued successfully that the proposed labels needlessly encroached on their right to free speech, in part because they included images of high emotional salience that indiscriminately frightened rather than informed consumers.
Methods We used functional {MRI} to examine the effects of graphic warning labels’ emotional salience on smokers’ brain activity and cognition. Twenty-four smokers viewed a random sequence of blocks of graphic warning labels that have been rated high or low on an ‘emotional reaction’ scale in previous research.
Results We found that labels rated high on emotional reaction were better remembered, associated with reduction in the urge to smoke, and produced greater brain response in the amygdala, hippocampi, inferior frontal gyri and the insulae.
Conclusions Recognition memory and craving are, respectively, correlates of effectiveness of addiction-related public health communications and interventions, and amygdala activation facilitates the encoding of emotional memories. Thus, our results suggest that emotional reaction to graphic warning labels contributes to their public health impact and may be an integral part of the neural mechanisms underlying their effectiveness. Given the urgency of the debate about the constitutional risks and public health benefits of graphic warning labels, these preliminary findings warrant consideration while longitudinal clinical studies are underway.},

	abstract = {Background
In 1984, the United States Congress enacted legislation requiring four new warning labels for cigarettes; warning labels in the United States have not changed since then. Other countries, such as Canada, have taken a more active and aggressive approach. The purpose of this study was to examine how U.S. smokers and former smokers might respond to stronger and more graphic warnings for U.S. cigarettes packages.
Methods
Data were collected in 2003 and analyzed in 2004. The perceived impact and effectiveness of the more-explicit Canadian labels was examined among young adult smokers (n=572) and former smokers (n=191) between the ages of 18 and 24 years in the United States, using a web-based survey that allowed participants to view both the text-only and the text-plus-graphic warning labels.
Results
Both current and former smokers thought that cigarette warning labels with text plus graphics were substantially more of a deterrent than text-only labels. The perceived effectiveness of these labels was not only higher overall, but also for the specific areas of smoking-related health effects, prevention, cessation, and maintenance of abstinence. Few differences were noted by gender.
Conclusions
The findings from this study support previous research that has found that text-plus-graphic warning labels are more salient and potentially more effective than text-only labels.},

Warning labels have traditionally depicted graphic health consequences of smoking but emerging evidence suggests the distal consequences shown may prove less effective in prompting cessation among young adults. We used a novel micro-survey approach to compare novel and traditional warnings, and provide an empirical foundation for a larger study.
Methods: We recruited 4649 male and 2993 female participants aged 18–34 from Google Consumer Survey’s Australian panel of Android mobile phone users. A screening question resulted in a sample comprising 3183 daily, non-daily, and former smokers. Twenty images corresponding to social and health risks, tobacco industry denormalization, and secondhand smoke ({SHS}) were tested in paired comparisons where respondents selected the image they thought most likely to prompt cessation.
Results: Irrespective of smoking status, respondents rated messages featuring harm to children as most effective and industry denormalization messages and adult {SHS} warnings as least effective. Within smoker groups, daily smokers rated social concerns more highly; non-daily smokers were more responsive to {SHS} messages, and former smokers saw intimacy and cosmetic effects warnings as more effective than other groups.
Conclusions: While preliminary, the findings support emerging evidence that more diverse warning images may be required to promote cessation among all smoker sub-groups. Warnings depicting harm to vulnerable others appear to hold high potential and merit further investigation.},

	abstract = {Objective To review evidence on the impact of health warning messages on tobacco packages.
Data sources Articles were identified through electronic databases of published articles, as well as relevant ‘grey’ literature using the following keywords: health warning, health message, health communication, label and labelling in conjunction with at least one of the following terms: smoking, tobacco, cigarette, product, package and pack. Study selection and data extraction: Relevant articles available prior to January 2011 were screened for six methodological criteria. A total of 94 original original articles met inclusion criteria, including 72 quantitative studies, 16 qualitative studies, 5 studies with both qualitative and qualitative components, and 1 review paper: Canada (n=35), {USA} (n=29) Australia (n=16), {UK} (n=13), The Netherlands (n=3), France (n=3), New Zealand (n=3), Mexico (n=3), Brazil (n=2), Belgium (n=1), other European countries (n=10), Norway (n=1), Malaysia (n=1) and China (n=1).
Results The evidence indicates that the impact of health warnings depends upon their size and design: whereas obscure text-only warnings appear to have little impact, prominent health warnings on the face of packages serve as a prominent source of health information for smokers and non-smokers, can increase health knowledge and perceptions of risk and can promote smoking cessation. The evidence also indicates that comprehensive warnings are effective among youth and may help to prevent smoking initiation. Pictorial health warnings that elicit strong emotional reactions are significantly more effective.
Conclusions Health warnings on packages are among the most direct and prominent means of communicating with smokers. Larger warnings with pictures are significantly more effective than smaller, text-only messages.},

	abstract = {Background

With increasing frequency, addiction is conceived of as a brain disease, and such accounts seem especially pertinent with regard to the rapid delivery of nicotine to the brain via cigarette smoke. Moreover, drug administration trials (cigarette puffs) suggest that the behavior of smoking becomes automatized, with individuals developing prototypical approaches to smoking a cigarette. Compared with presumably more social activities, such as drinking alcohol, there may be little opportunity for social processes to influence smoking behavior. However, survey research examining smoking motivation often reveals a broadly defined ‘social’ factor and field research suggests that social context does influence smoking.


Argument

We posit that laboratory smoking research has largely ignored social contextual factors that may help to understand better the precise mechanisms underlying smoking behavior and smoking motivation.


Method

We reviewed laboratory studies examining the effect of social context (operationalized as modeling) on smoking behavior. Studies were identified by searching {PsychInfo} and Medline using the following keywords: smoking, nicotine, tobacco, cigarette, consumption, topography, puff, smoking behavior, cigarettes smoked, modeling, imitation, social context, social influence and peer pressure. The reference and citation lists of these studies were then searched to identify additional studies.


Conclusions

Few laboratory smoking studies target social context. Those few studies indicate that smoking behavior can be influenced by the presence of others. There is also some evidence that social context influences the effects of smoking as well as processes related to self-perception and self-regulation that reinforce smoking and hamper smoking cessation efforts.},

Thus, the objective of this paper is to bring the social norm approach to the attention of a wider – and specifically, marketing and social marketing – audience, in the hope that the practice, study and critical analysis of the approach can be widened and deepened. We begin this task by tracing the background of the social norm approach to its origins in psychology and social psychology and by discussing a number of typical social norm campaigns. Thereafter, we review four key characteristics of successful social norm campaigns. In our discussion, we return to a more theoretical discussion of how the social norm approach works, and we pose a number of questions that emerge from the paper.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Social networks are important in adolescent smoking behavior. Previous research indicates that peer context is a major causal factor of adolescent smoking behavior. To date, however, little is known about the influence of peer group structure on adolescent smoking behavior. {METHODS}: Studies that examined adolescent social networks with regard to their cigarette smoking behavior were identified through online and manual literature searches. Ten social network analysis studies involving a total of 28,263 adolescents were included in the final review. {RESULTS}: Of the 10 reviewed studies, 6 identify clique members, liaisons, and isolates as contributing factors to adolescent cigarette smoking. Significantly higher rates of smoking are noted among isolates than clique members or liaisons in terms of peer network structure. Eight of the reviewed studies indicate that peer selection or influence precedes adolescents' smoking behavior and intent to smoke. Such peer selection or influence accounts for a large portion of similarities among smoking adolescents. {CONCLUSION}: Adolescents who are identified as isolates are more likely to smoke and engage in risk-taking behaviors than others in the peer network structure. Given that the vast majority of current adult smokers started their smoking habits during adolescence, adolescent smoking prevention efforts will likely benefit from incorporating social network analytic approaches and focusing the efforts on isolates and other vulnerable adolescents from a peer selection and influence perspective.},

The goal of the present study was to determine if people can similarly function as smoking and nonsmoking cues capable of directly affecting smokers’ cue-induced craving.
Methods: Smokers (N = 72) borrowed cameras to take photos of the people in their lives around whom they do and do not smoke (“personal” smoking and nonsmoking people, {PS} and {PN}, respectively). Self-report and physiological cue reactivity to those photos were compared with smokers’ reactivity to photos of people unknown to them (“standard” smoking and nonsmoking people, {SS} and {SN}, respectively).
Results: Results suggest that the people around whom smokers regularly smoke ({PS}) can alone function as cues capable of eliciting patterns of reactivity similar to that evoked by proximal and environment smoking cues, namely, increased craving to smoke, negative affect, and excitement. In contrast, the people around whom smokers do not smoke become associated with not smoking ({PN}) and serve a potential protective function by reducing craving and increasing calm.
Conclusions: This novel investigation and its results have implications for promoting smoking cessation by developing strategies to manage a smoker’s social environment.},

However, how policies (e.g., smoke free air laws) and social factors (e.g., social norms) drive the social unacceptability of tobacco use are not well understood. New research suggests that the stigmatization of smokers is an unrecognized force in the tobacco epidemic and could be one such mechanism. Thus, it is important to investigate the sources of smoker-related stigmatization as perceived by current and former smokers. In this study, we draw on the broader literature about stigma formation in the context of the tobacco epidemic and examine the role of attribution, fear, tobacco control policies, power and social norms in the formation of smoker-related stigma. We test hypotheses about the determinants of stigma using a population-based sample of 816 current and former smokers in New York City. The results show that perceptions of individual attributions for smoking behavior and fear about the health consequences of second hand smoke are important influences on smoker-related stigmatization. Structural forms of discrimination perpetrated against smokers and former smokers (e.g., company policies against hiring smokers) are also related to smoker-related stigma. Respondents with more education perceive more smoker-related stigma than respondents with less education and, Black and Latino respondents perceive less smoker-related stigma than White respondents. Social norms, specifically family and friends' expressed disapproval of smoking, contribute to the formation of smoker-related stigma. These findings suggest important points of leverage to harness the powerful role of stigma in the smoking epidemic and raise concerns about the possible role of stigma in the production of smoking disparities.},

	abstract = {Background
“Social smoking” – smoking mostly or even only with others – may be an important pattern that implies smoking motivated extrinsically by social influences. Non-daily smokers (intermittent smokers; {ITS}) are often assumed to be social smokers, with some authors even assuming that all {ITS} are social smokers ({SS}+). We sought to identify and characterize social smokers in a sample of {ITS}.
Methods
204 adult {ITS} (smoking 4–27 days/month) recorded the circumstances of smoking in their natural settings using Ecological Momentary Assessment, while also recording their circumstances in nonsmoking moments. {SS}+ were defined as {ITS} who were with others when they smoked most of their cigarettes, and who were ≥50\% more likely to be with others when smoking than when not.
Results
Only 13\% of {ITS} were {SS}+. Although defined solely on the basis of presence of others, {SS}+ showed a distinct pattern of smoking across multiple dimensions: compared to other {ITS} (who were significantly less likely to smoke when with others), {SS}+ smoking was more associated with socializing, being with friends and acquaintances, drinking alcohol, weekends, evening or nighttime, being in other people's homes, but not their own home. {SS}+ smoking was low in the morning and increased in the evening. {SS}+ smoked fewer days/week and were less dependent, but did not differ demographically.
Conclusions
Social smoking does constitute a highly distinct smoking pattern, but is not common among adult {ITS}.},

The results reveal that this type of automated measure of verbal mimicry can be an objective, efficient, and unobtrusive tool for predicting underlying social dynamics.

Pairs of speakers took it in turns to describe pictures to each other. One speaker was a confederate of the experimenter and produced scripted descriptions that systematically varied in syntactic structure. The syntactic structure of the confederate's description affected the syntactic structure of the other speaker's subsequent description. We suggest that these effects are instances of syntactic priming (Bock, 1986), and provide evidence for a shared level of representation in comprehension and production. We describe how these effects might be realized in a processing model of language production, and relate them to previous findings of linguistic co-ordination in dialogue.},

Using text-analysis, it was possible to assess the degree to which people coordinate their word use in natural conversations. In Experiments 1 (n = 130) and 2 (n = 32), college students interacted in dyadic conversations in laboratory-based private Internet chat rooms. Experiment 3 analyzed the official transcripts of the Watergate tapes involving the dyadic interactions between President Richard Nixon and his aids H. R. Haldeman, John Erlichman, \& John Dean. The results of the three studies offer substantial evidence that individuals in dyadic interactions exhibit linguistic style matching ({LSM}) on both the conversation level as well as on a turn-by-turn level. Furthermore, {LSM} is unrelated to ratings of the quality of the interaction by both participants and judges. We propose that a coordination-engagement hypothesis is a better description of linguistic behaviors than the coordination-rapport hypothesis that has been proposed in the nonverbal literature.},

These graphs contain many subgraphs in good agreement with known functional brain systems. Other subgraphs lack established functional identities; we suggest possible functional characteristics for these subgraphs. Further, graph measures of the areal network indicate that the default mode subgraph shares network properties with sensory and motor subgraphs: it is internally integrated but isolated from other subgraphs, much like a “processing” system. The modified voxelwise graph also reveals spatial motifs in the patterning of systems across the cortex.},

Narcissists have avoidant attachment styles, maintain distance in relationships and claim not to need others. However, they are especially sensitive to others’ evaluations, needing positive reflected appraisals to maintain their inflated self-views, and showing extreme responses (e.g. aggression) when rejected. The current study tested the hypothesis that narcissists also show hypersensitivity in brain systems associated with distress during exclusion. We measured individual differences in narcissism (Narcissistic Personality Inventory) and monitored neural responses to social exclusion (Cyberball). Narcissism was significantly associated with activity in an a priori anatomically defined social pain network (anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex) during social exclusion. Results suggest hypersensitivity to exclusion in narcissists may be a function of hypersensitivity in brain systems associated with distress, and suggests a potential pathway that connects narcissism to negative consequences for longer-term physical and mental health—findings not apparent with self-report alone.},

We derive here a parametric approach to voxel-based meta-analysis, based on spatial statistics. In this method, the value of each voxel in the meta-analysis summary map reflects the proportion of studies reporting an activation within a specified local neighborhood. We threshold this map by testing whether voxel scores could have been expected had the activation peaks been generated at random locations. Our aim is to detect 'signal' regions, with scores that are unlikely to arise under such null hypothesis. The method is applicable to both fixed-effects (in which each study is considered as deriving from the same generating process) and random-effects (in which the process varies across studies) meta-analysis. Simulations show strict false positive control, and this approach leads to increased power and substantial gains in computational time relative to existing simulation-based alternatives. We illustrate the technique by performing a random-effects meta-analysis of word production. Parametric voxel-based meta-analysis provides a powerful and practical tool for neuroimaging meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {The functional organization of human medial frontal cortex ({MFC}) is a subject of intense study. Using {fMRI}, the {MFC} has been associated with diverse psychological processes, including motor function, cognitive control, affect, and social cognition. However, there have been few large-scale efforts to comprehensively map specific psychological functions to subregions of medial frontal anatomy. Here we applied a meta-analytic data-driven approach to nearly 10,000 {fMRI} studies to identify putatively separable regions of {MFC} and determine which psychological states preferentially recruit their activation. We identified regions at several spatial scales on the basis of meta-analytic coactivation, revealing three broad functional zones along a rostrocaudal axis composed of 2–4 smaller subregions each. Multivariate classification analyses aimed at identifying the psychological functions most strongly predictive of activity in each region revealed a tripartite division within {MFC}, with each zone displaying a relatively distinct functional signature. The posterior zone was associated preferentially with motor function, the middle zone with cognitive control, pain, and affect, and the anterior with reward, social processing, and episodic memory. Within each zone, the more fine-grained subregions showed distinct, but subtler, variations in psychological function. These results provide hypotheses about the functional organization of medial prefrontal cortex that can be tested explicitly in future studies.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Activation of medial frontal cortex in {fMRI} studies is associated with a wide range of psychological states ranging from cognitive control to pain. However, this high rate of activation makes it challenging to determine how these various processes are topologically organized across medial frontal anatomy. We conducted a meta-analysis across nearly 10,000 studies to comprehensively map psychological states to discrete subregions in medial frontal cortex using relatively unbiased data-driven methods. This approach revealed three distinct zones that differed substantially in function, each of which were further subdivided into 2–4 smaller subregions that showed additional functional variation. Each individual region was recruited by multiple psychological states, suggesting subregions of medial frontal cortex are functionally heterogeneous.},

No one has been more responsible for the awakening of interest in this area than Roger Schank and Bob Abelson. In their target article, they argue that narrative forms of mental representation, or "stories," are the basic ingredients of social knowledge that play a fundamental role in the comprehension of information conveyed in a social context, the storage of this information in memory, and the later communication of it to others. After explicating the cognitive processes that underlie the construction of narratives and their use in comprehension, memory and communication, the chapter authors consider the influence of stories on a number of more specific phenomena, including political judgment, marital relations and memory distortions that underlie errors in eyewitness testimony.   The provocativeness of the target chapter is matched by that of the companion articles, each of which not only provides an important commentary on Schank and Abelson's conceptualization, but also makes an important contribution to knowledge in its own right. The diversity of perspectives reflected in these articles, whose authors include researchers in linguistics, memory and comprehension, social inference, cognitive development, social judgment, close relationships, and social ecology, testifies to the breadth of theoretical and empirical issues to which the target chapter is potentially relevant. This volume is a timely and important contribution to research and theory not only in social cognition but in many other areas as well.},

University students (n = 200) in the state of Western Australia were randomly allocated to receive 1 of 2 e-mails with hyperlinks to tobacco control advertisements (“Toilet” and “Rubbish”) emphasizing the disgusting nature of smoking. Recipients followed a hyperlink to a Web page playing Toilet or Rubbish on endless loop. Viewers were encouraged to forward the e-mail to their friends and invited to complete an online survey about the advertisement. Unique downloads for each advertisement were identified by internet provider ({IP}) location and tallied by date and geographical location to assess subsequent dissemination beyond the initial 200 students. There were 826 unique viewings of the advertisements averaging 26.9 viewings per day for the first fortnight, followed by a lower average of 4.1 hits per day for the next 3.5 months. {IP} addresses identified hits from 3 other Australian states and 7 other countries. Online surveys were completed by 103 respondents (12.5\% of total hits) but included few smokers (n = 9). Significantly more respondents rated Toilet as “funny” compared with Rubbish (40\% vs. 11\%; p {\textless} .05), likely explaining why the former accounted for significantly more viewings than the latter (487 vs. 339; p {\textless} .001). There was a greater than fourfold return in dissemination for each initial e-mail sent but daily hits rapidly deteriorated over time. Entertainment appears to facilitate viral e-mails being forwarded onwards but only exceptionally compelling tobacco control materials are ever likely to become self-perpetuating.},

The translation approach reopens the controversy about a classical topic in development studies: the failure or success of the Green Revolution. The translation method helps us to understand how the previous explanations of the failure or success of the Green Revolution in Bali were socially constructed and how the presence and the identity of social groups involved in agriculture on Bali were negotiated during the controversy. J. Stephen Lansing's recent computer model of Balinese agriculture is examined as a new component of the Green Revolution technological package. The analysis shows that the success of Lansing's model is better understood as a result of his communication strategy than as a scientific achievement.},

In China, a significant obstacle to such changes is the stigma associated with these diseases. Thus one campaign intervention strategy is to train credible community popular opinion leaders to discuss these issues in everyday social venues. This study tested the effectiveness of such an approach on reducing {HIV}/{AIDS} stigma, across two years, from a sample of over 4500 market vendors, in three conditions. Results showed an increasing growth in market communication about intervention messages, and concomitant declines in stigmatizing attitudes, across time, with the greatest changes in community popular opinion leaders, significant changes in intervention non-opinion leaders, and little change in the control markets.},

The results reveal that high-individualism consumers are more willing than low-individualism consumers to transmit {WOM} in relation to satisfactory consumption experiences (vs. unsatisfactory), when {WOM} is unsolicited (vs. solicited), and when the context involves high perceived social risk (vs. low perceived social risk).

The research model is tested empirically using a convenience sample of 123 Israeli consumers, with regression models and a multiple discriminant analysis. Innovativeness and computer usage were found to explain opinion leadership and opinion seeking. Opinion leadership and opinion seeking predicted several computer-related outcomes. The findings can be used to identify and utilize the differing information search profiles for opinion leaders and seekers. The former use a variety of sources, such as store visits and category-specific newspapers and magazines. In contrast, seekers rely more on expert advice from opinion leaders. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

They are not people at the top of things so much as people at the edge of things, not leaders within groups so much as brokers between groups. The familiar two-step flow of communication is a compound of two very different network mechanisms: contagion by cohesion through opinion leaders gets information into a group, and contagion by equivalence generates adoptions within the group. Opinion leaders as brokers bear a striking resemblance to network entrepreneurs in social capital research. The complementary content of diffusion and social capital research makes the analogy productive. Diffusion research describes how opinion leaders play their role of brokering information between groups, and social capital research describes the benefits that accrue to brokers.},

Opinion leaders are important in social networks because of their ability to influence the attitudes and behaviours of others via their superior status, education, and social prestige. Many theories have been put forward to explain the formation, characteristics, and durability of social networks, but few address the issue of opinion leader identification. This paper proposes an improved mix framework for opinion leader identification in online learning communities. The framework is validated by an experimental study. By analysing textual content, user behaviour and time, this study ranked opinion leaders based on four distinguishing features: expertise, novelty, influence, and activity. Furthermore, the performances of opinion leaders were further investigated in terms of longevity and centrality. Experimental study on real datasets has shown that our framework effectively identifies opinion leaders in online learning communities.},

	abstract = {Most tests of cognitively oriented theories of health behavior are based on correlational data. Unfortunately, such tests are often biased, overestimating the accuracy of the theories they seek to evaluate. These biases are especially strong when studies examine health behaviors that need to be performed repeatedly, such as medication adherence, diet, exercise, and condom use. Several misleading data analysis procedures further exaggerate the theories’ predictive accuracy. Because correlational designs are not adequate for deciding whether a particular construct affects behavior or for testing one theory against another, most of the literature aiming to test these theories tells us little about their validity or completeness. Neither does the existing empirical literature support decisions to use these theories to design interventions. In addition to discussing problems with correlational data, this article offers ideas for alternative testing strategies.},

We focus in this article on learning and decision-making about {AIDS} in the context of high uncertainty about the disease and appropriate behavioral responses. We argue that social interactions are important for both. Using longitudinal survey data from rural Kenya and Malawi, we test this hypothesis. We investigate whether social interactions—and especially the extent to which social network partners perceive themselves to be at risk—exert causal influences on respondents’ risk perceptions and on one approach to prevention, spousal communication about the threat of {AIDS} to the couple and their children. The study explicitly allows for the possibility that important characteristics, such as unobserved preferences or community characteristics, determine not only the outcomes of interest but also the size and composition of networks. The most important empirical result is that social networks have significant and substantial effects on risk perceptions and the adoption of new behaviors even after we control for unobserved factors.},

Data from 53 articles published in 27 journals met criteria for the study. Fifty-five independent effect sizes coded from samples totaling N = 18,529 were meta-analyzed. Results indicate that the mean sample-size weighted effect size of the {SSC}-condom use relation was r = .22, and a number of conceptual variables were found to moderate this relationship. Specifically, communication about condom use (r = .25) and sexual history (r = .23) had significantly (p {\textless} .05) larger effect sizes than communication about safer sex (r = .18). In addition, {SSC} measures operationalized differently had significantly (p {\textless} .05) different effect sizes. From largest to smallest, these were behavioral format (r = .29), intentional format (r = .18), and self-efficacy format (r = .13). Measures that tried to assess persuasion attempts as compared with informational exchanges were not found to have significantly different effect sizes (p {\textgreater} .05). Further, methodological moderators tended to be unrelated to effect size. Implications for the future study of safer sexual communication as well as the importance of emphasizing communication skills in {HIV} preventive interventions are discussed.},

Given the strong effect of social norms and pressure, how can any innovation ever diffuse to the point where it becomes a new social norm? The seeming paradox of how a minority can influence the majority has not been explained well by prevailing social science theory. Computer simulations of the diffusion of a new behavior within the social network of a Bangladesh village led to the discovery of a new principle of social change that resolves this paradox. The results revealed the important but overlooked role played by boundaries that emerge within a social network and how such local boundaries affect the creation of a new social norm. A minority position can become the social norm by means of the process of bounded normative influence. As long as a minority maintains its majority status within its own, locally bounded portion of the network, then it can survive, recruit converts in the near surround, and establish its behavior as the norm for the netwrok as a whole. The process is accelerated when the minority subgroup is centrally located in the network and communicates more frequently and persuasively than the majority.},

	abstract = {Context: Family planning communications campaigns have been shown to increase contraceptive use, but it remains unclear whether exposure to messages about contraception through multiple media sources has a greater impact than exposure through one medium. Methods: Data from a nationally representative sample of 4,225 women who participated in the 1994 Tanzania Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice Survey and in the 1991-1992 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey were used to assess the impact of mass media family planning campaigns on contraceptive behavior. A bivariate analysis was conducted to study the association between social and demographic characteristics, family planning communications campaigns and contraceptive behavior; multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between specific media campaigns and contraceptive use. Results: The more types of media that women are exposed to, the more likely they are to practice contraception. Women who recalled six media sources of family planning messages were 11 times as likely as women who recalled no media sources to be using modern contraceptives. Even women who recalled only one media source with a family planning message were twice as likely as women who recalled no media source to be using a modern method. Women who recalled family planning messages in the media were also more likely to have discussed family planning with their spouse and to have visited a health facility than were women who could not remember any such intervention. After introduction of controls for other variables, women who recalled radio messages about family planning were 1.7 times as likely as women who reported no exposure through radio programs to have discussed family planning with their spouse and were 1.9 times as likely to have been currently using family planning. Conclusions: Multiple media sources of information on contraception reinforce one another and extend the reach of a family planning campaign. Complementary messages may help to create an environment where the practice of contraception is perceived as a social norm. Varied media should continue to be used to promote family planning and other reproductive health issues.},

	abstract = {Reward maximization is a core motivation of every organism. In humans, several brain regions have been implicated in the representation of reward magnitude. Still, it is unclear whether identical brain regions consistently play a role in reward prediction and its consumption. In this study we used coordinate-based {ALE} meta-analysis to determine the individual roles of the ventral striatum ({vSTR}) and the medial orbitofrontal cortex ({mOFC}/{VMPFC}) in the representation of reward in general and of reward magnitude in particular. Specifically, we wanted to assess commonalities and differences in regional brain activation during the passive anticipation and consumption of rewards. Two independent meta-analyses of neuroimaging data from the past decade revealed a general role for the {vSTR} in reward anticipation and consumption. This was the case particularly when the consumed rewards occurred unexpectedly or were uncertain. In contrast, for the {mOFC}/{VMPFC} the present meta-analytic data suggested a rather specific function in reward consumption as opposed to passive anticipation. Importantly, when considering only coordinates that compared different reward magnitudes, the same parts of the {vSTR} and the {mOFC}/{VMPFC} showed concordant responses across studies, although areas of coherence were regionally more confined. These meta-analytic data suggest that the {vSTR} may be involved in both prediction and consumption of salient rewards, and may also be sensitive to different reward magnitudes, while the {mOFC}/{VMPFC} may rather process the magnitude during reward receipt. Collectively, our meta-analytic data conform with the notion that these two brain regions may subserve different roles in processing of reward magnitude.},

This approach has itself been criticized by one of its founders, Ulric Neisser (1982), for its narrowness and artificiality compared with the nature of remembering in natural contexts. A re-examination of Bartlett's work demonstrates that it offers little basis for an information processing approach, but rather that it offers the foundation of a much broader, culturally contextualized and functional approach to the study of everyday remembering. Three particular themes are discussed: the integration of social judgements and affective reactions with cognition, the role of conventional symbols in the coding and communication of experience, and the importance of conversational discourse. Bartlett's best-known studies, involving the method of serial reproduction, are shown to be microcosmic demonstrations of the process that he was most concerned with—that of conventionalization of symbols rather than of the workings of an individual's memory. It is argued, again beginning with Bartlett, that everyday remembering may be most fruitfully studied in terms of its personal and social functions, and particularly through its realization in discourse.},

In order to test these three explanations, data from the 2000 {ANES} and a local community survey during the 1996 presidential election were employed. Findings suggest that the direct relationship between discussion and knowledge may be mediated through motivations and information processing behaviors.

	abstract = {There is evidence that we may be more likely to share stories about other people to the extent that they arouse emotion. If so, this emotional social talk may have important social consequences, providing the basis for many of our social beliefs and mobilising people to engage or disengage with the targets of the talk. Across three studies, we tested the situated communicability of emotional social information by examining if the ability of emotionality to increase communicability would depend on the emotion that was aroused and the identity of the audience. Study 1 showed that participants were more willing to share social anecdotes that aroused interest, surprise, disgust and happiness with an unspecified audience. Study 2 provided a behavioural replication of these findings. Study 3 showed that the communicability of emotional social talk did vary with audience identity (friend or stranger). Together, these findings suggest that emotional social events (particularly those that arouse disgust and happiness) are likely to become part of a society's social beliefs, with important consequences for the structure of social relationships.

	abstract = {We present a model of contagion that unifies and generalizes existing models of the spread of social influences and microorganismal infections. Our model incorporates individual memory of exposure to a contagious entity (e.g. a rumor or disease), variable magnitudes of exposure (dose sizes), and heterogeneity in the susceptibility of individuals. Through analysis and simulation, we examine in detail the case where individuals may recover from an infection and then immediately become susceptible again (analogous to the so-called {SIS} model). We identify three basic classes of contagion models which we call epidemic threshold, vanishing critical mass, and critical mass classes, where each class of models corresponds to different strategies for prevention or facilitation. We find that the conditions for a particular contagion model to belong to one of the these three classes depend only on memory length and the probabilities of being infected by one and two exposures, respectively. These parameters are in principle measurable for real contagious influences or entities, thus yielding empirical implications for our model. We also study the case where individuals attain permanent immunity once recovered, finding that epidemics inevitably die out but may be surprisingly persistent when individuals possess memory.},

In this Letter, we introduce a general model of contagion which, by explicitly incorporating memory of past exposures to, for example, an infectious agent, rumor, or new product, includes the main features of existing contagion models and interpolates between them. We obtain exact solutions for a simple version of the model, finding that under general conditions only three classes of collective dynamics exist. Furthermore, we find that, for a given length of memory, the class into which a particular system falls is determined by only two parameters.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the feasibility, reach and potential behavioral impact of providing automated family planning information via mobile phones to the general public in Tanzania.
Study Design
Data from users of the Mobile for Reproductive Health (m4RH) program were collected during the 10-month pilot period. First, contraceptive methods queried by each user were electronically logged by the mobile phone system. Second, four text questions assessing gender, age, promotion point and potential family planning impact were sent to every user.
Results
During the pilot period, 2870 unique users accessed m4RH in Tanzania, resulting in 4813 queries about specific contraceptive methods. Among those responding to text questions, 56\% were female and approximately 60\% were 29 or younger years in age. A variety of changes in family planning use were mentioned after using m4RH, with reported changes consistent with where users are in their reproductive life cycle.
Conclusions
Reaching younger people, women and men of reproductive age with family planning information delivered via mobile phone is recommended.},

Enjoyment of feelings associated through social interaction motivates humans to build social connections according to their personal preferences. Therefore, we hypothesized that social interaction itself activates the reward system in a manner that depends upon individual interaction preferences. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) study in which 38 participants played a virtual ball-toss game in which the number of ball tosses to the participant was either similar to (normal-frequency condition) or higher than (high-frequency condition) the number of tosses to the other players. Participants reported greater-than-anticipated enjoyment during the high-frequency condition, suggesting that receiving a social reward led to unexpected positive feelings. Consistent with this, the high-frequency condition produced stronger activation in the ventral striatum, which is part of the reward system, and the precuneus, representing positive self-image, which might be translated to social reward. Furthermore, ventral striatal activation covaried with individual participants' preference for interactions with others. These findings suggest that an elevated frequency of social interaction is represented as a social reward, which might motivate individuals to promote social interaction in a manner that is modulated by personal preference.},

Results indicated that while the internet was integrated into college students’ social lives, face-to-face communication remained the dominant mode of interaction. Participants reported using the internet as often as the telephone. A survey compared reported use of the internet within local and long distance social circles to the use of other media within those circles, and examined participants’ most recent significant social interactions conducted across media in terms of purposes, contexts, and quality. Internet interaction was perceived as high in quality, but slightly lower than other media. Results were compared to previous conceptualizations of the roles of internet in one’s social life.},

A field experiment was conducted in a two-wave survey of randomly sampled citizens in Taiwan. The issue employed was Taiwan's political future in relation to the People's Republic of China. Results are consistent with major inoculation findings and support the study's core hypotheses: Inoculation treatments enhanced people's resistance to attitude change. People who received an inoculation pre-treatment, as compared with those who did not, became more confident in their attitude over time, more willing to speak out on behalf of one's attitudes, and more likely to overtly resist the counter-attitudinal attempts of others to influence oneself.},

Through an examination of the conceptual bases of persuasion, it is posited that the World Wide Web and other Internet-based resources have many of the characteristics necessary for persuasive communication and may, in fact, constitute a hybrid channel that combines the positive attributes of interpersonal and mass communication. The notion that the Internet features many of the persuasive qualities of interpersonal communication makes it a prime candidate for the application of key behavioral science theories and principles to promote healthier behaviors. The broad reach that the Internet shares with many mass communication channels indicates an economy to Internet-based efforts to communicate with large audiences. It is concluded that if the Internet can be used for persuasive health communication and its reach continues to expand, it is time for public health professionals to explore the design and evaluation of Internet-based interventions directed at health behavior change.},

The survey includes questions relating to recently broadcast antismoking advertisements, including whether smokers have received pressure from family and friends as a result of their seeing the advertisements. The authors conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to predict: (a) receiving ad-stimulated interpersonal pressure; and (b) quitting outcomes. All analyses controlled for smoker characteristics and potential exposure to the advertisements. Compared with ads coded as having a low level of emotion (by independent coders), ads coded as highly emotional were more likely to have generated interpersonal pressure. Ad-stimulated interpersonal pressure was associated with an increased likelihood of recent quit attempts and with salient quitting thoughts, with a greater effect on quitting thoughts for interpersonal pressure generated by highly and moderately emotional ads. These results support previous research suggesting that highly emotional antismoking ads with personal stories or graphic imagery are effective in promoting smoking cessation, and these results help to identify communication processes that contribute to the ads' success.},

Results indicated that public service announcements ({PSAs}) were often viewed in the company of friends and significant others, and that it was not uncommon for conversations about the {PSAs} to take place. Three broad categories of conversations that took place involved discussions about {PSA} realism, the seriousness of the message, and humor.

	shorttitle = {Mass media campaigns to promote smoking cessation among adults},
	abstract = {Objective This review summarises the impact of mass media campaigns on promoting quitting among adult smokers overall and for subgroups; the influence of campaign intensity and different channels; the effects of different message types.
Methods The present work updates two reviews published in 2008 by searching databases using a standard search string. Articles in languages other than English were excluded, as well as letters and editorials. Screening of abstracts yielded 194 potentially relevant articles. Abstracts were evaluated by 2 authors, excluding articles that focused on populations other than adults and according to other specified criteria, resulting in 26 studies reported in 29 articles. Studies were categorised as (a) population-based studies of campaign effects and (b) studies comparing message types, using either population-based or forced exposure methods. Findings of subgroup differences for each study were noted, as well as study strengths and limitations.
Results Overall, the studies have strengthened the evidence that mass media campaigns conducted in the context of comprehensive tobacco control programmes can promote quitting and reduce adult smoking prevalence, but that campaign reach, intensity, duration and message type may influence success. Achievement of sufficient population exposure is vital, especially for lower socioeconomic status smokers, with television remaining the primary channel to effectively reach and influence adult smokers. Studies comparing different message types found negative health effects messages most effective at generating increased knowledge, beliefs, positive perceived effectiveness ratings, or quitting behaviour, while there was more mixed evidence for other message types. A few studies further suggest that negative health effects messages may also contribute to reductions in socioeconomic disparities in smoking.
Conclusions Mass media campaigns to promote quitting are important investments as part of comprehensive tobacco control programmes to educate about the harms of smoking, set the agenda for discussion, change smoking attitudes and beliefs, increase quitting intentions and quit attempts, and reduce adult smoking prevalence. Jurisdictions should aim for high reach and consistent exposure over time with preference towards negative health effects messages.},

We use an ecological perspective to examine the ways in which mass media interventions can be used to influence public behavior both directly and indirectly. Mass media interventions that seek to influence people directly—by directly targeting the people burdened by the public health problem of concern and/or the people who influence them—have a long basis in public health history, and recent reviews have clarified our expectations about what can be expected from such approaches. Mass media interventions that seek to influence people indirectly—by creating beneficial changes in the places (or environments) in which people live and work—have equal if not greater potential to promote beneficial changes in population health behaviors, but these are currently less explored options. To have the greatest possible beneficial influence on public behavior with the public health resources available, we recommend that public health program planners assess their opportunities to use media to target both people and places in a manner that complements and extends other investments being made in population health enhancement.},

Moreover, the emphasis will be on theories that seek to explain some aspect of communicative conduct. Although social interaction is clearly prerequisite for establishing and maintaining personal relationships, some theories of relationship development do not necessarily offer explanations for social interaction per se. Rather, such theories seek to explain the residues of social interactions by recourse to retrospective, memory-based judgments and accounts that are presumed to have resulted from face-to-face interaction. That is, events that have transpired during social interactions are assumed to drive current characterizations and evaluations of relationships, but the events themselves are neither directly observed nor explained.},

	abstract = {This article outlines the dynamic nature of interpersonal discussion about politics and its interactive influence with mass media on candidate issue stances during U.S. presidential campaigns. Using data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey ({NAES}) for illustration purposes, we show that the interactive relationship between news media and political talk is not static or consistently significant throughout elections. Rather, our illustration shows a rough correspondence between major campaign events and a significant negative interaction between political talk and news media use on knowledge of candidate issue stances. We theorize that major campaign media events influence the sheer amount of discussion citizens engage in, and we show that an increase in discussion coincides with an amplification of inaccuracies concerning knowledge of candidate issue stances. This may be due to the increase in the number of individuals talking about politics after these major campaign events, which in turn produces an overall increase in political discussion across the electorate. This influx of new discussants after major campaign events increases the proportion of what we call “seasonal discussants.” Increasing the proportion of voters who tune in to the debates or conventions may not do much to increase the levels of expertise in follow-up discussions among citizens.},

	abstract = {Recent communication research concerning participatory politics has found that the effects of media, especially campaign ads, conventional news, and online political resources, are largely mediated through interpersonal discussion about politics. This article extends this line of theorizing about the role of political conversation in citizen competence by testing an O-S-R-O-R model of campaign communication mediation, a modification and extension of the longstanding O-S-O-R model of communication effects. This model combines insights from iterations of the communication mediation model ({McLeod} et al., 2001; Shah et al., 2007) and cognitive mediation model (Eveland, 2001; Eveland, Shah, \& Kwak, 2003) to theorize a set of the interrelated reasoning (R) processes that channel the influences of campaign exposure and news consumption on political engagement. Three key mediators of campaign and news influence are postulated: face-to-face political conversation, online political messaging, and cognitive reflection. We provide empirical evidence to test this model by merging two datasets: (1) tracking of the content and placement of campaign messages in the 2000 and 2004 election cycles, and (2) surveys of traditional and digital media consumption and levels of campaign participation during these same elections. Findings reveal that political conversation, political messaging, and cognitive reflection mediate the effects of campaign advertising exposure and news consumption on political participation and knowledge, providing considerable support for our theory. This O-S-R-O-R model helps organize a large body of theorizing and research on campaigns and conversation in the communication sciences.},

Tropes require additional cognitive elaboration to arrive at the intended interpretation, thereby providing the audience with “the pleasure of text.” This characteristic makes them useful for conversations in which ads are used to demonstrate one’s interpretation abilities or to strengthen group identity through a shared appreciation of ads. Tropes can thus stimulate people to think and talk about information they might otherwise ignore. As a result, this information is primed, increasing the chance that it will influence relevant behavior. At the same time, the use of tropes may have undesirable side effects, such as yielding incomprehension or misunderstanding of the message’s meaning.},

Substantial progress has been made in building models of the processes involved, and identifying underlying neural mechanisms using simple, two-alternative forced choice decision tasks. However, less attention has been given to how social information influences these processes, and the neural systems that mediate this influence. Here we sought to address these questions by using tasks similar to ones that have been used to study individual decision making behavior, and adding conditions in which participants were given trial-by-trial information about the performance of other individuals (their choices and/or their rewards) simultaneously playing the same tasks. We asked two questions: How does such information about the behavior of others influence performance in otherwise simple decision tasks, and what neural systems mediate this influence? We found that bilateral insula exhibited a parametric relationship to the degree of misalignment of the individual's performance with those of others in the group. Furthermore, activity in the bilateral insula significantly predicted participants' subsequent choices to align their behavior with others in the group when they were misaligned either in their choices (independent of success) or their degree of success (independent of specific choices). These findings add to the growing body of empirical data suggesting that the insula participates in an important way in social information processing and decision making.},

The developed time-series models innovatively uncover (1) short- and long-term effects of {NWOM} on cash flows, stock returns, and stock volatilities, and (2) {NWOM}'s “wear-in” effects (i.e., it takes a number of months before the stock price impact of {NWOM} reaches the peak point) and “wear-out” effects (i.e., it takes several months after the peak before the stock price impact of {NWOM} dies out completely). In addition, the results related to endogeneity and feedback effects from the stock market are also interesting, supporting the idea that historical underperformance in stock prices may breed more harmful future buzz in a “vicious” cycle of {NWOM}. After controlling for competition, {NWOM}'s long-term financial harm becomes more destructive in magnitude, kicks in more quickly, and haunts investors longer. Overall, these findings offer some unique implications for buzz management, time-series models quantifying the financial impact of word of mouth, and the marketing-finance interface.},

In contrast, this study investigates the negative side of customer experience and tests the harmful impact of consumer negative voice on firms' stock returns. Based on a longitudinal real-world data set that matches consumer negative voice (complaint records) in the airline industry with firm stock prices, this article finds that higher levels of current consumer negative voice harm firms' future idiosyncratic stock returns. In addition, this harmful impact is robust (albeit different across airline companies) after latent heterogeneity and traditional finance fundamentals are considered. These findings enable marketers and corporate financers to be more confident with customer equity theory and customer relationship management. In addition, armed with “hard” data (record-based, longitudinal), this research helps relieve criticisms against prior studies that are based on “soft” data (survey-based, cross-sectional). To financial analysts, this research suggests that, all else being equal, they should rate downward the stocks of firms that are shadowed by harmful consumer negative voice. In today's high-tech environment with blogs and online forums, the damage caused by negative voice may be nontrivial and should not be ignored. Overall, this research demonstrates to managers that investments in reducing consumer negative voice could indeed make financial sense in terms of promoting firm-idiosyncratic stock returns.},

	abstract = {Interpersonal communication has been shown to directly and indirectly influence various health behaviors, including smoking-related outcomes. However, the literature in this domain has mostly measured interpersonal communication as face-to-face conversations, and has treated such instances of communication as distinct from online forms of person-to-person communication. This dissertation is aimed at exploring sharing – an all-encompassing concept of person-to-person communication that covers both offline and online forms of communication – in the context of tobacco and e-cigarette communication, through three separate studies. Study 1 was a validation study that assessed the reliability and validity of a newly proposed sharing measure, providing a valid measure that could not only be used in the subsequent studies of this dissertation but also in future studies examining sharing in the tobacco and e-cigarette domain. In an effort to explore the nature of sharing, Study 2 examined the determinants of overall tobacco and e-cigarette sharing as well as sharing positive vs. negative tobacco and e-cigarette content. Findings showed that personal relevance and exposure to relevant information predicted sharing, and that personal relevance and normative perceptions interacted in their effects on the valence in which people shared. Study 3 was aimed at examining the consequences of sharing about tobacco and e-cigarettes. Specifically, it examined the direct effects of sharing on future intentions and behavior, as well as the contingent effects of sharing and pre-existing intentions on future behavior. Findings showed that sharing positive content increased the likelihood of intending to use and actually using tobacco and e-cigarettes. Furthermore, sharing consistently with intentions amplified the effect of those intentions on future behavior, while sharing inconsistently with intentions reduced such effects. Possible explanations for findings and potential areas for future research are discussed.},

Each section contains a minimum of four chapters that cover a specific aspect of approach and avoidance motivation.

	abstract = {Identifying social influence in networks is critical to understanding how behaviors spread. We present a method that uses in vivo randomized experimentation to identify influence and susceptibility in networks while avoiding the biases inherent in traditional estimates of social contagion. Estimation in a representative sample of 1.3 million Facebook users showed that younger users are more susceptible to influence than older users, men are more influential than women, women influence men more than they influence other women, and married individuals are the least susceptible to influence in the decision to adopt the product offered. Analysis of influence and susceptibility together with network structure revealed that influential individuals are less susceptible to influence than noninfluential individuals and that they cluster in the network while susceptible individuals do not, which suggests that influential people with influential friends may be instrumental in the spread of this product in the network.
A randomized experiment based on product adoption among Facebook friends identified trend setters and followers.

	abstract = {Background 
The context in which patients consume health information has changed dramatically with diffusion of the Internet, advances in telemedicine, and changes in media health coverage. The objective of this study was to provide nationally representative estimates for health-related uses of the Internet, level of trust in health information sources, and preferences for cancer information sources.Methods
Data from the Health Information National Trends Survey were used. A total of 6369 persons 18 years or older were studied. The main outcome measures were online health activities, levels of trust, and source preference.Results
Analyses indicated that 63.0\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 61.7\%-64.3\%) of the {US} adult population in 2003 reported ever going online, with 63.7\% (95\% {CI}, 61.7\%-65.8\%) of the online population having looked for health information for themselves or others at least once in the previous 12 months. Despite newly available communication channels, physicians remained the most highly trusted information source to patients, with 62.4\% (95\% {CI}, 60.8\%-64.0\%) of adults expressing a lot of trust in their physicians. When asked where they preferred going for specific health information, 49.5\% (95\% {CI}, 48.1\%-50.8\%) reported wanting to go to their physicians first. When asked where they actually went, 48.6\% (95\% {CI}, 46.1\%-51.0\%) reported going online first, with only 10.9\% (95\% {CI}, 9.5\%-12.3\%) going to their physicians first.Conclusion
The Health Information National Trends Survey data portray a tectonic shift in the ways in which patients consume health and medical information, with more patients looking for information online before talking with their physicians.},

Study 1 manipulated argument quality and assessed cognitive responses to demonstrate that this influence of trustworthiness on persuasion holds for familiar endorsers likely to be used in actual advertisements. Study 2 demonstrated that trustworthiness can be influenced by individuals endorsing too many products, with similar persuasion consequences (i.e., untrustworthy endorsers prompt greater scrutiny of product-related attributes than trustworthy endorsers). Study 2 also found that the attitudes that resulted from an untrustworthy endorser came to mind faster, even when those attitudes were equivalently positive—thus demonstrating that elaboration can influence attitude accessibility. This research provides evidence that attitude extremity may not be a sufficient indicator of advertising effectiveness, in that equally extreme attitudes can vary as to the bases by which they were formed, their underlying strength, and their effectiveness. Further, this research provides theoretical and strategic insight into the use of trustworthy and untrustworthy endorsers.},

Results from two research methods are reported: group interviews and large sample surveys. A series of group interviews with mothers of small children provided information about how they commonly diagnose illnesses related to childhood diarrheal disease as well as which symptoms, causes, and treatments they associate with those illnesses. Data from the interviews were used to formulate questions about the diagnosis of illness and treatments given for recent cases of diarrhea. A baseline and a follow‐up survey provided information about the symptoms associated with reported episodes of illness and about the treatments given at home. The results provide evidence that ethnomedical diagnoses are based on observed symptoms, that they affect how and why oral rehydration therapy ({ORT}) is used or not used for diarrhea, and that the terms chosen by survey researchers to ask about diarrhea and {ORT} may affect survey results in predictable and systematic ways.},

Converging evidence demonstrates that activity within brain systems associated with self-related processing can predict individual behavior in response to health messages. Preliminary evidence also suggests that neural activity in small groups can forecast population level campaign outcomes. Less is known about the psychological processes that link neural activity and population level outcomes, or how these predictions are affected by message content. We exposed 50 smokers to anti-smoking messages and used their aggregated neural activity within a ‘self-localizer’ defined region of medial prefrontal cortex to predict the success of the same campaign messages at the population level (n=400,000 emails). Results demonstrate that: 1) independently-localized neural activity during health message exposure complements existing self-report data in predicting population level campaign responses (model combined R2 up to .65) and 2) this relationship depends on message content—self-related neural processing predicts outcomes in response to strong negative arguments against smoking and not in response to compositionally similar neutral images. These data advance understanding of the psychological link between brain and large-scale behavior and may aid the construction of more effective media health campaigns.},

Even though a lot of information is shared in Twitter, little is known yet about how and why certain information spreads more widely than others. In this paper, we examine a number of features that might affect retweetability of tweets. We gathered content and contextual features from 74M tweets and used this data set to identify factors that are significantly associated with retweet rate. We also built a predictive retweet model. We found that, amongst content features, {URLs} and hashtags have strong relationships with retweetability. Amongst contextual features, the number of followers and followees as well as the age of the account seem to affect retweetability, while, interestingly, the number of past tweets does not predict retweetability of a user's tweet. We believe that this research would inform the design of sensemaking and analytics tools for social media streams.},

	abstract = {In order to mobilise action against a social problem, public service communicators often include normative information in their persuasive appeals. Such messages can be either effective or ineffective because they can normalise either desirable or undesirable conduct. To examine the implications in an environmental context, visitors to Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park were exposed to messages that admonished against the theft of petrified wood. In addition, the messages conveyed information either about descriptive norms (the levels of others' behaviour) or injunctive norms (the levels of others' disapproval) regarding such thievery. Results showed that focusing message recipients on descriptive normative information was most likely to increase theft, whereas focusing them on injunctive normative information was most likely to suppress it. Recommendations are offered for optimising the impact of normative messages in situations characterised by objectionable levels of undesirable conduct.

The study was concerned with the prediction of intention to engage in household recycling and reported recycling behaviour. A sample of 143 community residents participated in the study. It was prospective in design: measures of the predictors and intention were obtained at the first wave of data collection, whereas behaviour was assessed two weeks later. Selfidentity significantly predicted behavioural intention, a relationship that was not dependent on the extent to which the behaviour had been performed in the past. As expected, there was also evidence that the perceived norm of a behaviourally relevant reference group was related to behavioural intention, but only for participants who identified strongly with the group, whereas the relationship between perceived behavioural control (a personal factor) and intention was strongest for low identifiers.},

The model performed well, with perceived behavioral control serving as an antecedent to both behavioral intention and behavior. Furthermore, conditions under which perceived behavioral control can be expected to be a stronger versus a weaker predictor of behavior and behavioral intention are identified. Four such moderators are identified, and causal models are estimated at each level of the moderator. The results show that perceived behavioral control is a stronger predictor of behavior when it (a) is operationalized as a global (vs. belief-based) measure, (b) is conceptualized to reflect control over factors primarily internal (vs. external) to an individual, and (c) is used for nonstudent (vs. student) samples and familiar (vs. unfamiliar) behaviors. Perceived behavioral control is found to be a stronger predictor of behavioral intention with student (vs. nonstudent) samples and familiar (vs. unfamiliar) behaviors and is equally predictive under the operationalization (global or belief) and conceptualization (internal or external control) moderators.},

	abstract = {The Theory of Planned Behaviour ({TPB}) has received considerable attention in the literature. The present study is a quantitative integration and review of that research. From a database of 185 independent studies published up to the end of 1997, the {TPB} accounted for 27\% and 39\% of the variance in behaviour and intention, respectively. The perceived behavioural control ({PBC}) construct accounted for significant amounts of variance in intention and behaviour, independent of theory of reasoned action variables. When behaviour measures were self-reports, the {TPB} accounted for 11\% more of the variance in behaviour than when behaviour measures were objective or observed (R2s = .31 and .21, respectively). Attitude, subjective norm and {PBC} account for significantly more of the variance in individuals' desires than intentions or self-predictions, but intentions and self-predictions were better predictors of behaviour. The subjective norm construct is generally found to be a weak predictor of intentions. This is partly attributable to a combination of poor measurement and the need for expansion of the normative component. The discussion focuses on ways in which current {TPB} research can be taken forward in the light of the present review.},

The most commonly used theoretical model to predict this behaviour has been the theory of planned behaviour ({TPB}) and its predecessor, the theory of reasoned action. This study includes a sample of 275 people of the general public holding a current driving licence. Its general aim is to predict the intention to commit two different driving violations: speeding in an urban area and dangerous overtaking by an expanded version of the {TPB} containing separate measures of descriptive norms and past behaviour. The results show that both past behaviour and descriptive norm make a unique contribution towards the prediction of intention to violate. Furthermore, it also found that the effect of descriptive norms is greater in a situation described as ‘risky’. The effect of age and annual mileage were significant with regard to speeding indicating that young drivers and those who use the car regularly are more likely to speed. Implications of the current findings for the development of intervention programmes are discussed.},

	abstract = {This {fMRI} study was set up to explore how cognitive empathy, i.e. the cognitive inference on another person's affective state, can be characterized as a distinct brain function relating to pre-existing neurofunctional concepts about mentalizing and empathy. In a 3 Tesla {MRI} scanner 28 healthy participants were presented with four different instructions randomly combined with 32 false-belief cartoon stories of 3 subsequent pictures free of direct cues for affective states, like e.g. facial expressions. Participants were instructed to judge affective or visuospatial changes from their own (1st person perspective) or the protagonists' (3rd person perspective, 3rdpp) perspective. 3rdpp-judgements about affective states differed from visuospatial 3rdpp judgements by a significantly higher activation of the anterior mentalizing network (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, anterior superior temporal sulcus, temporal poles) and the limbic system (left amygdala and hippocampus). Analysis of main effects revealed that the anterior part of the mentalizing network was activated significantly stronger by affective compared to visuospatial content. In contrast, the temporoparietal junction was rather activated by 3rdpp visuospatial judgements. After all, our results demonstrate a functional dissociation between cognitive empathy and cognitive visuospatial perspective taking. The simultaneous activation of the cortical mentalizing network and the amygdala indicates that cognitive empathy actually involves reference to own affective states in the observer. Notably, the cognitive reference to own affective states activated the mentalizing network as well. Moreover our results support pre-existing ideas about a functional anterior–posterior subdivision of the mentalizing network, depending on affective content and 3rd person perspective of cognition.},

In the paradigm most commonly used to address this concept, a subject is presented with trait adjectives or sentences and asked whether they describe him or her. Functional neuroimaging research has revealed a set of regions known as Cortical Midline Structures ({CMS}) appearing to be critically involved in self-reflection processes. Furthermore, it has been shown that patients suffering damage to the {CMS}, have difficulties in properly evaluating the problems they encounter and often overestimate their capacities and performance. Building on previous work, a meta-analysis of published {fMRI} and {PET} studies on self-reflection was conducted. The results showed that two areas within the medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}) are important in reflective processing, namely the ventral (v) and dorsal (d) {MPFC}. In this paper a model is proposed in which the {vMPFC} is responsible for tagging information relevant for ‘self’, whereas the {dMPFC} is responsible for evaluation and decision-making processes in self- and other-referential processing. Finally, implications of the model for schizophrenia and lack of insight are noted.},

A competing hypothesis argues that when behaviors require social reinforcement, a network with more clustering may be more advantageous, even if the network as a whole has a larger diameter. I investigated the effects of network structure on diffusion by studying the spread of health behavior through artificially structured online communities. Individual adoption was much more likely when participants received social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the social network.

We use social information to evaluate and form expectations of others and to make decisions involving others. Here we review research demonstrating how the neural circuitry of reward, particularly the striatum, is also involved in processing social information and making decisions in social situations. This research provides an understanding of the neural basis for social behavior from the perspective of how we evaluate social experiences and how our social interactions and decisions are motivated. We review research addressing the common neural systems underlying evaluation of social and nonsocial rewards. The human striatum, known to play a key role in reward processing, displays signals related to a broad spectrum of social functioning, including evaluating social rewards, making decisions influenced by social factors, learning about social others, cooperating, competing, and following social norms. {WIREs} Cogn Sci 2014, 5:61–73. doi: 10.1002/wcs.1266 Conflict of interest: The authors have declared no conflicts of interest for this article.

But, unlike typical findings, personal-level risk was found to be influenced, to some degree, by mass media channels. Interpersonal channels account for a portion of the variance on social-level risk judgment, as does self-efficacy.

European Americans and Asian-born Asians (total N = 398) reported their social orientation on multiple scales. They were also genotyped for {DRD}4. As in earlier work, European Americans were more independent, and Asian-born Asians more interdependent. This cultural difference was significantly more pronounced for carriers of the 7- or 2-repeat alleles than for noncarriers. Indeed, no cultural difference was apparent among the noncarriers.

In the present study, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a prosocial learning task in which they could choose to benefit themselves and/or another person. Choice behavior indicated that participants valued the welfare of another person, although less so than they valued their own welfare. Neural data revealed a spatial gradient in activity within the medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}), such that ventral parts predominantly represented self-regarding values and dorsal parts predominantly represented other-regarding values. Importantly, compared with selfish individuals, prosocial individuals showed a more gradual transition from self-regarding to other-regarding value signals in the {MPFC} and stronger {MPFC}–striatum coupling when they made choices for another person rather than for themselves. The present study provides evidence of neural markers reflecting individual differences in human prosociality.},

We examined how the brain generates this pervasive optimism bias. Here we report that this tendency was related specifically to enhanced activation in the amygdala and in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex when imagining positive future events relative to negative ones, suggesting a key role for areas involved in monitoring emotional salience in mediating the optimism bias. These are the same regions that show irregularities in depression, which has been related to pessimism. Across individuals, activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex was correlated with trait optimism. The current study highlights how the brain may generate the tendency to engage in the projection of positive future events, suggesting that the effective integration and regulation of emotional and autobiographical information supports the projection of positive future events in healthy individuals, and is related to optimism.},

	abstract = {Tracking new topics, ideas, and "memes" across the Web has been an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. However, these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and events. We develop a framework for tracking short, distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a "heartbeat"-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits.},

This article introduces a new broad method, Web memetics, comprising extensive Web searches and combined quantitative and qualitative analyses, to identify and assess: (a) the different versions of a meme, (b) its evolution online, and (c) its Web presence and translation into common Internet languages. This method is demonstrated through one extensively circulated joke about men, women, and computers. The results show that the joke has mutated into several different versions and is widely translated, and that translations incorporate small, local adaptations while retaining the English versions' fundamental components. In conclusion, Web memetics has demonstrated its ability to identify and track the evolution and spread of memes online, with interesting results, albeit for only one case study.},

	abstract = {{AbstractPurpose}
Social influence is prominent across the lifespan, but sensitivity to influence is especially high during adolescence and is often associated with increased risk taking. Such risk taking can have dire consequences. For example, in American adolescents, traffic-related crashes are leading causes of nonfatal injury and death. Neural measures may be especially useful in understanding the basic mechanisms of adolescents' vulnerability to peer influence.
Methods
We examined neural responses to social exclusion as potential predictors of risk taking in the presence of peers in recently licensed adolescent drivers. Risk taking was assessed in a driving simulator session occurring approximately 1 week after the neuroimaging session.
Results
Increased activity in neural systems associated with the distress of social exclusion and mentalizing during an exclusion episode predicted increased risk taking in the presence of a peer (controlling for solo risk behavior) during a driving simulator session outside the neuroimaging laboratory 1 week later. These neural measures predicted risky driving behavior above and beyond self-reports of susceptibility to peer pressure and distress during exclusion.
Conclusions
These results address the neural bases of social influence and risk taking; contribute to our understanding of social and emotional function in the adolescent brain; and link neural activity in specific, hypothesized, regions to risk-relevant outcomes beyond the neuroimaging laboratory. Results of this investigation are discussed in terms of the mechanisms underlying risk taking in adolescents and the public health implications for adolescent driving.},

	abstract = {Social influence drives both offline and online human behavior. It pervades cultural markets, and manifests itself in the adoption of scientific and technical innovations as well as the spread of social practices. Prior empirical work on the diffusion of innovations in spatial regions or social networks has largely focused on the spread of one particular technology among a subset of all potential adopters. Here we choose an online context that allows us to study social influence processes by tracking the popularity of a complete set of applications installed by the user population of a social networking site, thus capturing the behavior of all individuals who can influence each other in this context. By extending standard fluctuation scaling methods, we analyze the collective behavior induced by 100 million application installations, and show that two distinct regimes of behavior emerge in the system. Once applications cross a particular threshold of popularity, social influence processes induce highly correlated adoption behavior among the users, which propels some of the applications to extraordinary levels of popularity. Below this threshold, the collective effect of social influence appears to vanish almost entirely, in a manner that has not been observed in the offline world. Our results demonstrate that even when external signals are absent, social influence can spontaneously assume an on–off nature in a digital environment. It remains to be seen whether a similar outcome could be observed in the offline world if equivalent experimental conditions could be replicated.},

Six studies demonstrate that compared with narrowcasting (i.e., communicating with just one person), broadcasting (i.e., communicating with multiple people) leads consumers to avoid sharing content that makes them look bad. Narrowcasting, however, encourages people to share content that is useful to the message recipient. These effects are driven by communicators' focus of attention. People naturally tend to focus on the self, but communicating with just one person heightens other-focus, which leads communicators to share less self-presenting content and more useful content. These findings shed light on the drivers of word of mouth and provide insight into when the communication sender (vs. receiver) plays a relatively larger role in what people share.},

This large sample allowed us to investigate group differences in brain activation to Theory of Mind tasks with unusually high sensitivity. There were no differences between neurotypical participants and those diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.

Hence, the task of predicting the popularity of news items on the social web is both interesting and challenging. Prior research has dealt with predicting eventual online popularity based on early popularity. It is most desirable, however, to predict the popularity of items prior to their release, fostering the possibility of appropriate decision making to modify an article and the manner of its publication. In this paper, we construct a multi-dimensional feature space derived from properties of an article and evaluate the efficacy of these features to serve as predictors of online popularity. We examine both regression and classification algorithms and demonstrate that despite randomness in human behavior, it is possible to predict ranges of popularity on twitter with an overall 84\% accuracy. Our study also serves to illustrate the differences between traditionally prominent sources and those immensely popular on the social web.},

Consistent with predictions derived from the impersonal impact hypothesis, the effects of mass communication were more evident in perceptions of risk to others rather than in perceptions of personal risk. Perceptions of personal risk were more strongly correlated with interpersonal communication. However, as suggested by media system dependency theory, the relationship between mass communication and beliefs was complex. The impact of mass communication on both personal and impersonal perceptions was found to be moderated by self-reported dependence on mass mediated information. The effect of this two-way interaction on perceptions of personal risk was partially mediated through interpersonal communication. Results point to the interdependence of mass and interpersonal communication as sources of social influence and the role of media dependency in shaping media impact.},

	abstract = {It is often noted that some individuals become aware of a mass media program's messages through discussions with other individuals. However, the extent to which indirect exposure occurs, and its influence on behavior, are somewhat unclear. This study examines the role of indirect exposure in extending the reach of a family planning mass media campaign in Nepal. Sociometric data, gathered from nearly all women between the ages of 15 and 49 years living in six villages in Dang District, Nepal (N = 667), assessed indirect exposure to the radio program. Indirect exposure was extensive; half of all respondents were indirectly exposed to the program's messages and the overall reach of the program increased from 50\% to 75\% when indirect exposure was considered. Members of community groups had higher levels of direct exposure to the radio program and more extensive and diverse social networks, allowing them to serve as a conduit for these messages into the wider community. While direct exposure to the radio program appeared to influence family planning knowledge, indirect exposure was more strongly associated with contraceptive use. These findings suggest that program evaluations that ignore indirect exposure underestimate the impact of a mass media program on behavior.},

The mass media campaign consisted of 3 different newspaper advertisements, 1 poster, and 1 television and movie spot. The study population consisted of all adolescents ages 17 and 18 in 1 county in Norway. A questionnaire, focusing on short-term reactions toward the campaign, was mailed to the home addresses of the adolescents in the intervention county (N = 4,994). The response rate was 64.4\%. Among the respon- dents, more than half recalled having been exposed to the campaign. For the present mass media campaign, the recall was highest among nonsmoking boys, and overall, boys showed the most positive affective reactions and girls the most negative affective reactions. A higher percentage of girls than boys had dis- cussed the campaign. The highest proportion of positive behavioral reactions was seen in boys. The strongest predictors of positive behavioral outcomes were positive affective reactions and having discussed the campaign with someone, particularly a peer. Both positive and negative affective responses predicted discussion, which in turn influenced positive behavioral outcome. Negative reactions were seen among the smokers in particular.},

Although voters come to election campaigns with an array of opinions on candidates, issues, and parties, because candidates' personal qualities are highlighted by the media and parties are ignored, those voters more highly exposed to the media become increasingly likely to base their vote on candidate evaluations, and increasingly unlikely to base the decision on their party identification. On the other hand, this article demonstrates that interpersonal communications can act as a buffer to this tendency. Talking about politics over the course of the campaign primes issues. The argument is supported through use of a rolling cross section employed in the 1988 Canadian election.},

How effective are such campaigns in changing health-related attitudes and behaviors, however, and how has the literature in this area progressed over the past decade? The purpose of the current article is threefold. First, I discuss the importance of health mass media campaigns and raise the question of whether they are capable of effectively impacting public health. Second, I review the literature and discuss what we have learned about the effectiveness of campaigns over the past 10 years. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of possible avenues for the health campaign literature over the next 10 years. The overriding conclusion is the following: The literature is beginning to amass evidence that targeted, well-executed health mass media campaigns can have small-to-moderate effects not only on health knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes, but on behaviors as well, which can translate into major public health impact given the wide reach of mass media. Such impact can only be achieved, however, if principles of effective campaign design are carefully followed.},

Different patterns emerged for participation in a civic forum, with interpersonal discussion having the strongest impact of the three communication variables. Television news use had no direct impact on either type of participation, but it did have a modest indirect impact on institutionalized participation. The data also showed direct effects of dimensions of community integration for participation in a forum only. Orientations toward the larger community rather than the local neighborhood were positively related to participating in a civic forum.},

The study also aimed at exploring the role of interpersonal communication in the process of behaviour change. The mass media campaign included both printed and electronic material, and the evaluation survey was performed 14 days after the first campaign period. A questionnaire was mailed to the home address of the study population, which included all adolescents (N=5051) aged 15 and 16 in one county in Norway. The response rate was 73\%. The campaign (which targeted girls in particular) obtained the best short-term effects among girls and among smokers.

Overall, smokers had stronger affective reactions towards the campaign than non-smokers had and girls reacted more strongly than boys.

The measurement of the independent variable was improved by an individual matching procedure of content analysis data and the media use patterns of each respondent. Whereas the aggregate-level analysis shows the usually high correspondence between media and societal agenda, the individual-level comparison of whole issue agendas indicates mutual dependencies, with the personal agenda leading the individual media agenda more frequently. Several path analysis models for single-issue relevance reveal that the importance of an issue in the actually received media coverage exerts only little influence on the assessment of issue importance of a respondent. Instead, personal factors, such as issue involvement, interpersonal communication, and the issue assessment of the network partners, exert a substantial impact.},

This study included 1,694 adult current smokers or persons who had quit smoking during the past year, out of a total of 6,011 respondents. Smoking cessation attempts during the past 12 months were examined as a dependent variable. Reported exposures to mass media and interpersonal health communication were examined as possible determinants of smoking cessation. Weekly exposure to mass media health messages was significantly associated with cessation attempts among men only. In contrast, interpersonal health communication, or social influence, was a significant determinant of cessation attempts among both sexes. Exposure to both mass media and interpersonal health communication had an even stronger impact on cessation attempts. Thus, interpersonal communication appears to be an important catalyst of community programs, and its inclusion should be emphasized to obtain a higher impact with community programs.},

	abstract = {Context: Mass media campaigns have been used in social marketing programs designed to prevent {HIV} infection by changing sexual behavior. More information is needed about the effectiveness of these campaigns and the mechanisms through which they influence behavior. Methodology: Data on 2,712 sexually experienced men and women in Tanzania, collected in an exit survey at outlets that sell the female condom, were used to determine if a mass media campaign promoting the female condom had an impact on women's and men's intentions to use this method. Respondents were asked about their exposure to the mass media campaign, to peer education and to explanation of the female condom by a medical provider. They were also asked about their intention to use the female condom in the future. Path analysis was used to determine the impact of the three exposure factors on respondents' intentions to use the female condom. Results: About 6\% of respondents had been exposed to peer education and 6\% had been given an explanation by a provider on the use of the female condom. In contrast, about 38\% of respondents had been exposed to the mass media campaign promoting the female condom. Mass media exposure significantly increased the likelihood that a man or a woman would discuss use of the female condom with a partner. In turn, discussion of the female condom with a partner strongly influenced the intention to use the female condom in the future. Peer educators and providers had limited coverage, but they had a stronger impact than the mass media on an individual's intention to use the female condom. Conclusions: Although mass media campaigns do not have as strong an impact on a particular individual's motivation to use the female condom as do peer educators or providers, such campaigns have a substantial impact at the population level because of their considerably greater reach.},

Methods   In 11 independent studies (total N = 2,250), we demonstrate the {SINS}' psychometric properties.      Results   The {SINS} is significantly correlated with longer narcissism scales, but uncorrelated with self-esteem. It also has high test-retest reliability. We validate the {SINS} in a variety of samples (e.g., undergraduates, nationally representative adults), intrapersonal correlates (e.g., positive affect, depression), and interpersonal correlates (e.g., aggression, relationship quality, prosocial behavior). The {SINS} taps into the more fragile and less desirable components of narcissism.      Significance   The {SINS} can be a useful tool for researchers, especially when it is important to measure narcissism with constraints preventing the use of longer measures.},

	abstract = {We study several longstanding questions in media communications research, in the context of the microblogging service Twitter, regarding the production, flow, and consumption of information. To do so, we exploit a recently introduced feature of Twitter known as "lists" to distinguish between elite users - by which we mean celebrities, bloggers, and representatives of media outlets and other formal organizations - and ordinary users. Based on this classification, we find a striking concentration of attention on Twitter, in that roughly 50\% of {URLs} consumed are generated by just 20K elite users, where the media produces the most information, but celebrities are the most followed. We also find significant homophily within categories: celebrities listen to celebrities, while bloggers listen to bloggers etc; however, bloggers in general rebroadcast more information than the other categories. Next we re-examine the classical "two-step flow" theory of communications, finding considerable support for it on Twitter. Third, we find that {URLs} broadcast by different categories of users or containing different types of content exhibit systematically different lifespans. And finally, we examine the attention paid by the different user categories to different news topics.},

	abstract = {Self-regulation is a critical ability for maintaining a wide range of health behaviors, especially in preventing overeating and weight gain. Previous work has identified various threats to self-control in the eating domain, chief among which are desire strength and negative affect. In the present study, we examined individual differences in college-aged dieters' experiences of these threats as they encountered temptations to eat in their daily lives, and tested whether these differences characterized sub-groups of dieters with divergent self-control outcomes. Specifically, 75 dieting females (age range: 18-23) participated in a combined functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and experience sampling study. Participants passively viewed food cues during a {fMRI} session, and then reported their daily eating behaviors for one week via ecological momentary assessment. We examined the characteristics of dieters who exhibited the most favorable combination of the aforementioned factors (i.e., low desire strength and positive mood) and who were thus most successful at regulating their eating. These dieters endorsed more autonomous reasons for their self-regulatory goals, and during the food cue reactivity task more readily recruited the inferior frontal gyrus, a brain region associated with inhibitory control. We suggest that these motivational and neural correlates may also be implicated in self-regulation of other important health behaviors.},

	abstract = {Mounting evidence over the last few years suggest that published neuroscience research suffer from low power, and especially for published {fMRI} experiments. Not only does low power decrease the chance of detecting a true effect, it also reduces the chance that a statistically significant result indicates a true effect (Ioannidis, 2005). Put another way, findings with the least power will be the least reproducible, and thus a (prospective) power analysis is a critical component of any paper. In this work we present a simple way to characterize the spatial signal in a {fMRI} study with just two parameters, and a direct way to estimate these two parameters based on an existing study. Specifically, using just (1) the proportion of the brain activated and (2) the average effect size in activated brain regions, we can produce closed form power calculations for given sample size, brain volume and smoothness. This procedure allows one to minimize the cost of an {fMRI} experiment, while preserving a predefined statistical power. The method is evaluated and illustrated using simulations and real neuroimaging data from the Human Connectome Project. The procedures presented in this paper are made publicly available in an online web-based toolbox available at www.neuropowertools.org.},

Here we propose that these sites’ popularity can be understood through the fulfillment of ego needs. We use self-affirmation theory to hypothesize why and when people spend time on their online profiles. Study 1 shows that Facebook profiles are self-affirming in the sense of satisfying users’ need for self-worth and self-integrity. Study 2 shows that Facebook users gravitate toward their online profiles after receiving a blow to the ego, in an unconscious effort to repair their perceptions of self-worth. In addition to illuminating some of the psychological factors that underlie Facebook use, the results provide an important extension to self-affirmation theory by clarifying how self-affirmation operates in people’s everyday environments.},

	abstract = {Today, online social networks have become powerful tools for the spread of information. They facilitate the rapid and large-scale propagation of content and the consequences of an information -- whether it is favorable or not to someone, false or true -- can then take considerable proportions. Therefore it is essential to provide means to analyze the phenomenon of information dissemination in such networks. Many recent studies have addressed the modeling of the process of information diffusion, from a topological point of view and in a theoretical perspective, but we still know little about the factors involved in it. With the assumption that the dynamics of the spreading process at the macroscopic level is explained by interactions at microscopic level between pairs of users and the topology of their interconnections, we propose a practical solution which aims to predict the temporal dynamics of diffusion in social networks. Our approach is based on machine learning techniques and the inference of time-dependent diffusion probabilities from a multidimensional analysis of individual behaviors. Experimental results on a real dataset extracted from Twitter show the interest and effectiveness of the proposed approach as well as interesting recommendations for future investigation.},

Quantifying the causal effect of these mediums on the dissemination of information requires not only identification of who influences whom, but also of whether individuals would still propagate information in the absence of social signals about that information. We examine the role of social networks in online information diffusion with a large-scale field experiment that randomizes exposure to signals about friends' information sharing among 253 million subjects in situ. Those who are exposed are significantly more likely to spread information, and do so sooner than those who are not exposed. We further examine the relative role of strong and weak ties in information propagation. We show that, although stronger ties are individually more influential, it is the more abundant weak ties who are responsible for the propagation of novel information. This suggests that weak ties may play a more dominant role in the dissemination of information online than currently believed.},

Drawing on {YouTube} popularity-measurements and on user-generated playlists, a corpus of 30 prominent memetic videos was assembled. A combined qualitative and quantitative analysis of these videos yielded six common features: focus on ordinary people, flawed masculinity, humor, simplicity, repetitiveness and whimsical content. Each of these attributes marks the video as incomplete or flawed, thereby invoking further creative dialogue. In its concluding section, the article addresses the skyrocketing popularity of mimicking in contemporary digital culture, linking it to economic, social and cultural logics of participation.},

Using content and network analysis of 1013 meme instances (including videos, images, and text), we explore memes' prevalent quiddity types and generic features, and the ways in which they relate to each other. Our findings show that (a) higher cohesiveness of meme families is associated with a greater uniqueness of their generic attributes; and (b) the concreteness of meme quiddities is associated with cohesiveness and uniqueness. We discuss the implications of these findings to the understanding of internet memes and participatory culture.},

	abstract = {There is a widespread intuitive sense that different kinds of information spread differently on-line, but it has been difficult to evaluate this question quantitatively since it requires a setting where many different kinds of information spread in a shared environment. Here we study this issue on Twitter, analyzing the ways in which tokens known as hashtags spread on a network defined by the interactions among Twitter users. We find significant variation in the ways that widely-used hashtags on different topics spread. Our results show that this variation is not attributable simply to differences in "stickiness," the probability of adoption based on one or more exposures, but also to a quantity that could be viewed as a kind of "persistence" - the relative extent to which repeated exposures to a hashtag continue to have significant marginal effects. We find that hashtags on politically controversial topics are particularly persistent, with repeated exposures continuing to have unusually large marginal effects on adoption; this provides, to our knowledge, the first large-scale validation of the "complex contagion" principle from sociology, which posits that repeated exposures to an idea are particularly crucial when the idea is in some way controversial or contentious. Among other findings, we discover that hashtags representing the natural analogues of Twitter idioms and neologisms are particularly non-persistent, with the effect of multiple exposures decaying rapidly relative to the first exposure. We also study the subgraph structure of the initial adopters for different widely-adopted hashtags, again finding structural differences across topics. We develop simulation-based and generative models to analyze how the adoption dynamics interact with the network structure of the early adopters on which a hashtag spreads.},

Here, we trace such information-spreading processes at a person-by-person level using methods to reconstruct the propagation of massively circulated Internet chain letters. We find that rather than fanning out widely, reaching many people in very few steps according to “small-world” principles, the progress of these chain letters proceeds in a narrow but very deep tree-like pattern, continuing for several hundred steps. This suggests a new and more complex picture for the spread of information through a social network. We describe a probabilistic model based on network clustering and asynchronous response times that produces trees with this characteristic structure on social-network data.},

	abstract = {Differences in popularity are a key aspect of status in virtually all human groups and shape social interactions within them. Little is known, however, about how we track and neurally represent others’ popularity. We addressed this question in two real-world social networks using sociometric methods to quantify popularity. Each group member (perceiver) viewed faces of every other group member (target) while whole-brain functional {MRI} data were collected. Independent functional localizer tasks were used to identify brain systems supporting affective valuation (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, amygdala) and social cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, temporoparietal junction), respectively. During the face-viewing task, activity in both types of neural systems tracked targets’ sociometric popularity, even when controlling for potential confounds. The target popularity–social cognition system relationship was mediated by valuation system activity, suggesting that observing popular individuals elicits value signals that facilitate understanding their mental states. The target popularity–valuation system relationship was strongest for popular perceivers, suggesting enhanced sensitivity to differences among other group members’ popularity. Popular group members also demonstrated greater interpersonal sensitivity by more accurately predicting how their own personalities were perceived by other individuals in the social network. These data offer insights into the mechanisms by which status guides social behavior.},

	abstract = {We propose that the cognitive mechanisms that enable the transmission of cultural knowledge by communication between individuals constitute a system of ‘natural pedagogy’ in humans, and represent an evolutionary adaptation along the hominin lineage. We discuss three kinds of arguments that support this hypothesis. First, natural pedagogy is likely to be human-specific: while social learning and communication are both widespread in non-human animals, we know of no example of social learning by communication in any other species apart from humans. Second, natural pedagogy is universal: despite the huge variability in child-rearing practices, all human cultures rely on communication to transmit to novices a variety of different types of cultural knowledge, including information about artefact kinds, conventional behaviours, arbitrary referential symbols, cognitively opaque skills and know-how embedded in means-end actions. Third, the data available on early hominin technological culture are more compatible with the assumption that natural pedagogy was an independently selected adaptive cognitive system than considering it as a by-product of some other human-specific adaptation, such as language. By providing a qualitatively new type of social learning mechanism, natural pedagogy is not only the product but also one of the sources of the rich cultural heritage of our species.},

	abstract = {Objective: To identify what features of social media – promotional messaging or peer networks – can increase physical activity. Method: A 13-week social media-based exercise program was conducted at a large Northeastern university in Philadelphia, {PA}. In a randomized controlled trial, 217 graduate students from the University were randomized to three conditions: a control condition with a basic online program for enrolling in weekly exercise classes led by instructors of the University for 13 weeks, a media condition that supplemented the basic program with weekly online promotional media messages that encourage physical activity, and a social condition that replaced the media content with an online network of four to six anonymous peers composed of other participants of the program, in which each participant was able to see their peers' progress in enrolling in classes. The primary outcome was the number of enrollments in exercise classes, and the secondary outcomes were self-reported physical activities. Data were collected in 2014. Results: Participants enrolled in 5.5 classes on average. Compared with enrollment in the control condition (mean = 4.5), promotional messages moderately increased enrollment (mean = 5.7, p = 0.08), while anonymous social networks significantly increased enrollment (mean = 6.3, p = 0.02). By the end of the program, participants in the social condition reported exercising moderately for an additional 1.6 days each week compared with the baseline, which was significantly more than an additional 0.8 days in the control condition. Conclusion: Social influence from anonymous online peers was more successful than promotional messages for improving physical activity.

Building on established theoretical concerns and the research possibilities enabled by large social datasets, we propose a framework for mapping information exposure of digitally situated individuals. We argue that from the perspective of an individual's personal communication network, comparable processes of “curation” are undertaken by a variety of actors—not only conventional newsmakers but also individual media users, social contacts, advertisers, and computer algorithms. Detecting the competition, intersection, and overlap of these flows is crucial to understanding media exposure and effects today. Our approach reframes research questions in debates such as polarization, selective and incidental exposure, participation, and conceptual orientations for computational approaches.},

It describes basic strengths and weaknesses of each technique, points to examples of how each technique has been used in neuroeconomic studies, and provides key tutorial references that contain more detailed information. In addition to this overview, the article presents a framework that organizes human neuroscience methods functionally, according to whether they provide tests of the association between brain activity and cognition or behavior, or whether they test the necessity or the sufficiency of brain activity for cognition and behavior. This framework demonstrates the utility of a multimethod research approach, because converging evidence from tests of association, necessity, and sufficiency provides the strongest inference regarding brain–behavior relationships. Set against this goal of converging evidence, human neuroscience studies in neuroeconomics currently rely far too heavily on methods that test association, most notably functional magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}).},

Previous empirical attempts to solve this puzzle all presuppose that formal or informal institutions, such as incentives for global agreement, coordinated leadership, or aggregated information about the population, are needed to facilitate a solution. Evolutionary theories of social conventions, by contrast, hypothesize that such institutions are not necessary in order for social conventions to form. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis have been hindered by the difficulties of evaluating the real-time creation of new collective behaviors in large decentralized populations. Here, we present experimental results—replicated at several scales—that demonstrate the spontaneous creation of universally adopted social conventions and show how simple changes in a population’s network structure can direct the dynamics of norm formation, driving human populations with no ambition for large scale coordination to rapidly evolve shared social conventions.},

Under most conditions that we consider, we find that large cascades of influence are driven not by influentials but by a critical mass of easily influenced individuals. Although our results do not exclude the possibility that influentials can be important, they suggest that the influentials hypothesis requires more careful specification and testing than it has received.},

	abstract = {When a disease breaks out in a human population, changes in behavior in response to the outbreak can alter the progression of the infectious agent. In particular, people aware of a disease in their proximity can take measures to reduce their susceptibility. Even if no centralized information is provided about the presence of a disease, such awareness can arise through first-hand observation and word of mouth. To understand the effects this can have on the spread of a disease, we formulate and analyze a mathematical model for the spread of awareness in a host population, and then link this to an epidemiological model by having more informed hosts reduce their susceptibility. We find that, in a well-mixed population, this can result in a lower size of the outbreak, but does not affect the epidemic threshold. If, however, the behavioral response is treated as a local effect arising in the proximity of an outbreak, it can completely stop a disease from spreading, although only if the infection rate is below a threshold. We show that the impact of locally spreading awareness is amplified if the social network of potential infection events and the network over which individuals communicate overlap, especially so if the networks have a high level of clustering. These findings suggest that care needs to be taken both in the interpretation of disease parameters, as well as in the prediction of the fate of future outbreaks.},

In everyday interactions, however, people often manage their impressions on several image-relevant dimensions simultaneously. By examining people's self-presentations to several targets across multiple dimensions, these 2 studies offer new insights into the nature of self-presentation and provide a novel paradigm for studying impression management. Results showed that most people rely on a relatively small number of basic self-presentational personas in which they convey particular profiles of impressions as a set and that these personas reflect both normative influences to project images that are appropriate to a particular target and distinctive influences by which people put an idiosyncratic spin on these normative images. Furthermore, although people's self-presentational profiles correlate moderately with their self-views, they tailor their public images to specific targets. The degree to which participants' self-presentations were normative and distinctive, as well as the extent to which they reflected their own self-views, were moderated by individual differences in agreeableness, self-esteem, authenticity, and Machiavellianism.},

I propose and find that posters (those communicating their experience to others) are influenced only by another's negative opinion because it triggers such social concerns as appearing indiscriminate. Consequently, they adjust their public attitudes downward. Self-presentational concerns appear to cause this negativity bias: lurkers (those not posting their opinion) were less affected by another's negative opinion. Furthermore, posters presented more than one side when publicly explaining their attitudes. These effects persisted despite posters' favorable product experiences and commitment to these attitudes.},

In Study 1, participants who adopted different identities in preliminary interactions with two other participants (acting the part of a studious nerd with one and a fun-loving party animal with the other) were able to preserve these identities when they interacted subsequently with both individuals at the same time. In Study 2, participants were able to communicate a secret word to one audience while simultaneously concealing it from another.

This cross-cultural study examines how audience-related variables affect a range of strategic self-presentation and image management behaviors online. Results from samples of Singaporean and American {SNS} users (N = 411) show that while Americans update their profiles with text-based wall posts more frequently, Singaporeans share significantly more photos. Audience diversity is positively associated with active management of other-provided information, and females share more photos and actively manage unwanted photo tagging. Cultural identity and the tendency to ‘friend’ unknown others interact on managing other-provided wall posts; individualistic cultural identity exhibited positive relationships with these reactions for those less likely to friend unknown others but negative ones for those more likely to friend unknown others. Implications for the theoretical understanding of and practical suggestions about self-presentation online are discussed.},

Moreover, items rated as self-relevant produce increased activity in these regions relative to items that are deemed not self-relevant. A common thread among previous reports has been reliance on experimental tasks that encourage or require online self-referential processing. In this paper, we report findings from two experiments that manipulated requirements for self-reflection. In Experiment 1, subjects rated trait adjectives for social desirability and for self-relevance. Results revealed increasing activity in {CMS} with increasing self-relevance, but only during explicit ratings of self-relevance. In Experiment 2, we examined {CMS} activity during passive viewing of personal semantic facts (such as subjects’ own first names). Taken together, these results suggest that highly self-relevant information captures attention through neural mechanisms that are comparable to those engaged during explicit self-reflection, namely via recruitment of {CMS} structures.},

This article argues that word of mouth is goal driven and serves five key functions (i.e., impression management, emotion regulation, information acquisition, social bonding, and persuasion). Importantly, I suggest these motivations are predominantly self- (rather than other) serving and drive what people talk about even without their awareness. Further, these drivers make predictions about the types of news and information people are most likely to discuss. This article reviews the five proposed functions and well as how contextual factors (i.e., audience and communication channel) may moderate which functions play a larger role. Taken together, the paper provides insight into the psychological factors that shape word of mouth and outlines additional questions that deserve further study.},

Important activation differences exist, however, depending upon the perceived competence of the advisor. Consistently, additional analyses demonstrate that integrating others' advice, i.e., how much participants actually adjust their initial estimate, correlates with neural activity in the centromedial amygdala in the case of a competent and with activity in visual cortex in the case of an incompetent advisor. Taken together, our findings, therefore, demonstrate that advice evaluation and integration rely on dissociable neural mechanisms and that significant differences exist depending upon the advisor's reputation, which suggests different modes of processing advice depending upon the perceived competence of the advisor.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ({PROMIS}®) Smoking Initiative has developed 6 item banks for assessing smoking behaviors and biopsychosocial correlates of smoking among daily and nondaily adult cigarette smokers. This paper presents descriptive information and preliminary validity evidence for the item banks (Nicotine Dependence, Coping Expectancies, Emotional and Sensory Expectancies, Health Expectancies, Psychosocial Expectancies, and Social Motivations).
Methods: Using data from a large sample of daily (N = 4,201) and nondaily (N = 1,183) smokers, we generated mean daily and nondaily smoking bank scores according to select demographic groups. We also examined correlations among the 6 banks and examined the associations of bank scores with smoking behavior items (e.g., quantity of smoking, interest in quitting) and select health-related quality of life measures (i.e., physical functioning, anxiety, alcohol consumption).
Results: Correlations among the 6 banks are moderate (daily mean r = .48, range = .04–.80; nondaily mean r = .47, range = .12–.75). The pattern of associations between bank scores and other measures provides validity evidence for the bank domains (e.g., nicotine dependence is most strongly associated with smoking quantity and time to first cigarette of the day; health and psychosocial expectancies are most related to quitting recency and interest; coping expectancies are strongly associated with anxiety).
Conclusions: These analyses provide useful descriptive information about the 6 smoking item banks as well as preliminary evidence for their validity. Independent sample data are currently being collected to replicate these findings, to establish test–retest reliability, and to develop crosswalks to existing smoking measures (e.g., nicotine dependence to Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence). Future research will also evaluate the bank scores’ sensitivity to change.},

	abstract = {Perceiving one's deviance from the majority usually instigates conformal adjustments of one's own behavior to that of the group. Using {ERPs}, we investigated the mechanisms by which agreeing and disagreeing with the majority are differentially represented in the human brain and affect subsequent cognitive processing. Replicating previous findings obtained in a slightly different paradigm, we found that learning about one's disagreement with the majority, as compared to learning about one's agreement with the majority, elicited a mediofrontal feedback negativity. Moreover, an enhanced posterior late positive complex was observed during the processing of agreement as compared to disagreement. Finally, when the to-be-judged faces were viewed for a second time, a stronger posterior P2 was observed for faces on whose judgment one had previously agreed with the majority than for those on which one had disagreed. We thus demonstrate that the brain places particular emphasis on the encoding of the rewarding experience of finding strong social proof for one's judgments. Likewise, having experienced agreement on the judgment of a certain item affects even the later reanalysis of this very item, as previous agreement increases early attention, as reflected in the P2. These findings corroborate and extend previous results and theories on the neurocognitive principles of social influence.},

	abstract = {Theory of mind ({ToM}) refers to the ability to represent one's own and others' cognitive and affective mental states. Recent imaging studies have aimed to disentangle the neural networks involved in cognitive as opposed to affective {ToM}, based on clinical observations that the two can functionally dissociate. Due to large differences in stimulus material and task complexity findings are, however, inconclusive. Here, we investigated the neural correlates of cognitive and affective {ToM} in psychologically healthy male participants (n = 39) using functional brain imaging, whereby the same set of stimuli was presented for all conditions (affective, cognitive and control), but associated with different questions prompting either a cognitive or affective {ToM} inference. Direct contrasts of cognitive versus affective {ToM} showed that cognitive {ToM} recruited the precuneus and cuneus, as well as regions in the temporal lobes bilaterally. Affective {ToM}, in contrast, involved a neural network comprising prefrontal cortical structures, as well as smaller regions in the posterior cingulate cortex and the basal ganglia. Notably, these results were complemented by a multivariate pattern analysis (leave one study subject out), yielding a classifier with an accuracy rate of more than 85\% in distinguishing between the two {ToM}-conditions. The regions contributing most to successful classification corresponded to those found in the univariate analyses. The study contributes to the differentiation of neural patterns involved in the representation of cognitive and affective mental states of others.

These data lend support to the notion that part of the fascination, and the credibility, of brain imaging research lies in the persuasive power of the actual brain images themselves. We argue that brain images are influential because they provide a physical basis for abstract cognitive processes, appealing to people's affinity for reductionistic explanations of cognitive phenomena.},

Most correlations remained significant after controlling for income and education. A cross-sectional regression model based only on Twitter language predicted {AHD} mortality significantly better than did a model that combined 10 common demographic, socioeconomic, and health risk factors, including smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.

	abstract = {A major challenge for decision theory is to account for the instability of expressed preferences across time and context. Such variability could arise from specific properties of the brain system used to assign subjective values. Growing evidence has identified the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({VMPFC}) as a key node of the human brain valuation system. Here, we first replicate this observation with an {fMRI} study in humans showing that subjective values of painting pictures, as expressed in explicit pleasantness ratings, are specifically encoded in the {VMPFC}. We then establish a bridge with monkey electrophysiology, by comparing single-unit activity evoked by visual cues between the {VMPFC} and the orbitofrontal cortex. At the neural population level, expected reward magnitude was only encoded in the {VMPFC}, which also reflected subjective cue values, as expressed in Pavlovian appetitive responses. In addition, we demonstrate in both species that the additive effect of prestimulus activity on evoked activity has a significant impact on subjective values. In monkeys, the factor dominating prestimulus {VMPFC} activity was trial number, which likely indexed variations in internal dispositions related to fatigue or satiety. In humans, prestimulus {VMPFC} activity was externally manipulated through changes in the musical context, which induced a systematic bias in subjective values. Thus, the apparent stochasticity of preferences might relate to the {VMPFC} automatically aggregating the values of contextual features, which would bias subsequent valuation because of temporal autocorrelation in neural activity.},

Ideally, an inside look at brain function would simultaneously and continuously measure the biochemical state of every cell in the central nervous system. While such a miraculous method is science fiction, a century of progress in neuroimaging technologies has made such simultaneous and continuous measurement a plausible fiction. Despite this progress, practitioners of modern neuroimaging struggle with two kinds of limitations: those that attend the particular neuroimaging methods we have today and those that would limit any method of imaging neural activity, no matter how powerful. In this essay, I consider the liabilities and potential of techniques that measure human brain activity. I am concerned here only with methods that measure relevant physiologic states of the central nervous system and relate those measures to particular mental states. I will consider in particular the preeminent method of functional neuroimaging: {BOLD} {fMRI}. While there are several practical limits on the biological information that current technologies can measure, these limits—as important as they are—are minor in comparison to the fundamental logical restraints on the conclusions that can be drawn from brain imaging studies.},

Expectancy was manipulated by telling subjects in group {SMOKE} that they could smoke, and subjects in group {NO} {SMOKE} that they could not smoke following each cue-reactivity session. The dependent variables were subjective ratings of “desire to smoke”, “high”, “withdrawal”, and mood, as well as latency to initiate smoking measured in group {SMOKE}. Statistical analyses demonstrated that only group {SMOKE} (a) reported greater “desire to smoke” and “withdrawal” to the smoking cues compared to the baseline, (b) reported greater “desire to smoke” to the smoking cues than to the unpleasant or to the neutral cues, and (c) smoked faster after the smoking cues than after the neutral cues. Both groups rated the unpleasant cues as affectively more negative than the neutral cues. The data suggest that the impact of drug-cues on craving and subsequent drug-use is due to their drug-related content, and not to negative affect. Furthermore, the impact of drug-related cues appears to be influenced by perceived drug-availability.},

The present study combined cue-reactivity with ecological momentary assessment ({CREMA}) to evaluate smokers' cue reactions in natural environments as a further validation and extension of this procedure. A total of 66 daily cigarette smokers carried a personal digital assistant ({PDA}) and had the opportunity to respond to 32 cue-reactivity sessions across 8 days. Cues were presented through in vivo and photographic modes. During in vivo sessions, participants handled and looked at a cigarette or neutral object, while during photographic sessions, participants looked at a smoking-related or neutral photograph on the {PDA}. Craving and mood were assessed before and after cue presentations. Cues were also presented in the laboratory both before (Lab I) and after (Lab {II}) the 8-day {CREMA} procedure. Participants completed over 90\% of cue-reactivity sessions delivered with the {CREMA} procedure. Analyses revealed robust cue-reactivity in the natural environment and laboratory across both modes of presentation. Photographic cues elicited significantly stronger cue-reactivity effects than in vivo cues across all sessions. The {CREMA} procedure has been shown to elicit robust cue-reactivity effects across multiple modes of cue presentation.

Here, we directly investigated whether understanding emotional feelings recruit similar or specific brain systems, relative to other non-emotional mental states. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging with multivoxel pattern analysis in 46 volunteers to compare activation patterns in theory-of-mind tasks for emotions, relative to beliefs or somatic states accompanied with pain. We found a striking dissociation between the temporoparietal cortex, that exhibited a remarkable voxel-by-voxel pattern overlap between emotions and beliefs (but not pain), and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, that exhibited distinct (and yet nearby) patterns of activity during the judgment of beliefs and emotions in others. Pain judgment was instead associated with activity in the supramarginal gyrus, middle cingulate cortex and middle insular cortex. Our data reveal for the first time a functional dissociation within brain networks sub-serving theory of mind for different mental contents, with a common recruitment for cognitive and affective states in temporal regions, and distinct recruitment in prefrontal areas.},

Developing the means to identify smokers at high risk for relapse could advance relapse prevention therapy. We hypothesized that functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) reactivity to smoking-related cues, measured before a quit attempt, could identify smokers with heightened relapse vulnerability.
Methods
Before quitting smoking, 21 nicotine-dependent women underwent {fMRI} during which smoking-related and neutral images were shown. These smokers also were tested for possible attentional biases to smoking-related words using a computerized emotional Stroop ({ES}) task previously found to predict relapse. Smokers then made a quit attempt and were grouped based on outcomes (abstinence vs. slip: smoking ≥ 1 cigarette after attaining abstinence). Prequit {fMRI} and {ES} measurements in these groups were compared.
Results
Slip subjects had heightened {fMRI} reactivity to smoking-related images in brain regions implicated in emotion, interoceptive awareness, and motor planning and execution. Insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ({dACC}) reactivity induced by smoking images correlated with an attentional bias to smoking-related words. A discriminant analysis of {ES} and {fMRI} data predicted outcomes with 79\% accuracy. Additionally, smokers who slipped had decreased {fMRI} functional connectivity between an insula-containing network and brain regions involved in cognitive control, including the {dACC} and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, possibly reflecting reduced top-down control of cue-induced emotions.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that the insula and {dACC} are important substrates of smoking relapse vulnerability. The data also suggest that relapse-vulnerable smokers can be identified before quit attempts, which could enable personalized treatment, improve tobacco-dependence treatment outcomes, and reduce smoking-related morbidity and mortality.},

Although activations have consistently been reported within the anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}), it remains unclear which {ACC} subdivision is particularly involved. To provide a quantitative estimation of the specific involvement of {ACC} subdivisions in social pain, we conducted a voxel-based meta-analysis. The literature search identified 46 articles that included 940 subjects, the majority of which used the cyberball task. Significant likelihoods of activation were found in both the ventral and dorsal {ACC} for both social pain elicitation and self-reported distress during social pain. Self-reported distress involved more specifically the subgenual and pregenual {ACC} than social pain-related contrasts. The cyberball task involved the anterior midcingulate cortex to a lesser extent than other experimental tasks. During social pain, children exhibited subgenual activations to a greater extent than adults. Finally, the ventro-dorsal gradient of {ACC} activations in cyberball studies was related to the length of exclusion phases. The present meta-analysis contributes to a better understanding of the role of {ACC} subdivisions in social pain, and it could be of particular importance for guiding future studies of social pain and its neural underpinnings.},

Choices between material goods are thought to be steered by neural value signals that encode the rewarding properties of the choice options. Social decisions, by contrast, are traditionally thought to rely on neural representations of the self and others. However, recent studies show that many types of social decisions may also involve neural value computations. This suggests a unified mechanism for motivational control of behaviour that may incorporate both social and non-social factors. In this Review, we outline a theoretical framework that may help to identify possible overlaps and differences between the neural processes that guide social and non-social decision making.

Most prominently, several studies have demonstrated the role of neural reinforcement-learning processes in conformal adjustments using a specifically designed and frequently replicated paradigm. Only very recently, the validity of the critical behavioral effect in this very paradigm was seriously questioned, as it invites the unwanted contribution of regression toward the mean. Using a straightforward control-group design, we corroborate this recent finding and demonstrate the involvement of statistical distortions. Additionally, however, we provide conclusive evidence that the paradigm nevertheless captures behavioral effects that can only be attributed to social influence. Finally, we present a mathematical approach that allows to isolate and quantify the paradigm’s true conformity effect both at the group level and for each individual participant. These data as well as relevant theoretical considerations suggest that the groundbreaking findings regarding the brain mechanisms of social conformity that were obtained with this recently criticized paradigm were indeed valid. Moreover, we support earlier suggestions that distorted behavioral effects can be rectified by means of appropriate correction procedures.},

In this paper, we capture some of these dynamics by measuring and characterizing patterns of coherent brain activity during the learning of a motor skill. We extract time-evolving communities from these patterns and find that a temporal core that is composed primarily of primary sensorimotor and visual regions reconfigures little over time, whereas a periphery that is composed primarily of multimodal association regions reconfigures frequently. The core consists of densely connected nodes, and the periphery consists of sparsely connected nodes. Individual participants with a larger separation between core and periphery learn better in subsequent training sessions than individuals with a smaller separation. Conceptually, core-periphery organization provides a framework in which to understand how putative functional modules are linked. This, in turn, enables the prediction of fundamental human capacities, including the production of complex goal-directed behavior.},

We found enhanced intersubject correlations among viewers with high-risk perception in the anterior cingulate, a region which classical {fMRI} studies associated with the appraisal of threatening information.

We tested whether neighborhood quality during adolescence would predict subsequent neural responding to social exclusion in young adulthood. Given previous behavioral studies indicating greater social vigilance and negative evaluation as a function of lower status, we expected that lower adolescent neighborhood quality would predict greater {dACC} activity during exclusion at young adulthood. Our findings indicate that young adults who lived in low-quality neighborhoods in adolescence showed greater {dACC} activity to social exclusion than those who lived in higher-quality neighborhoods. Lower neighborhood quality also predicted greater prefrontal activation in the superior frontal gyrus, dorsal medial prefrontal cortext, and the middle frontal gyrus, possibly indicating greater regulatory effort. Finally, this effect was not driven by subsequent ratings of distress during exclusion. In sum, adolescent neighborhood quality appears to potentiate neural responses to social exclusion in young adulthood, effects that are independent of felt distress.},

In addition, P1 amplitude, which reflects visual attention, was larger for disgusted faces than for neutral faces following social exclusion.

Justice sensitivity did not impact the neuro-hemodynamic response in the action-observation network but instead influenced higher-order computational nodes in the right temporoparietal junction ({rTPJ}), right dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ({rdlPFC}, {dmPFC}) that process mental states understanding and maintain goal representations. Activity in these regions predicted praise and blame ratings. Further, the hemodynamic response in {rTPJ} showed a differentiation between good and bad actions 2 s before the response in {rdlPFC}. Evaluation of good actions was specifically associated with enhanced activity in dorsal striatum and increased the functional coupling between the {rTPJ} and the anterior cingulate cortex. Together, this study provides important knowledge in how individual differences in justice sensitivity impact neural computations that support psychological processes involved in moral judgment and mental-state reasoning.},

Brain areas involved in social exclusion were identified and the functional connectivity between these areas was explored using psycho-physiological interactions ({PPI}). Results showed that while both groups presented dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ({dACC}) activations during social exclusion, alcohol-dependent participants exhibited increased insula and reduced frontal activations (in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) as compared with controls. Alcohol-dependence was also associated with persistent {dACC} and parahippocampal gyrus activations in re-inclusion. {PPI} analyses showed reduced frontocingulate connectivity during social exclusion in alcohol-dependence. Alcohol-dependence is thus linked with increased activation in areas eliciting social exclusion feelings ({dACC}–insula), and with impaired ability to inhibit these feelings (indexed by reduced frontal activations). Altered frontal regulation thus appears implied in the interpersonal alterations observed in alcohol-dependence, which seem reinforced by impaired frontocingulate connectivity. This first exploration of the neural correlates of interpersonal problems in alcohol-dependence could initiate the development of a social neuroscience of addictive states.},

	abstract = {Background
Abstinent drug users remain at risk for relapse long after withdrawal subsides. Animal studies indicate that responses to drug-related cues not only persist but increase with abstinence, a phenomenon termed “incubation of drug craving.” It is unknown whether cue-induced craving increases, decreases, or remains constant with abstinence in humans. We investigated effects of abstinence on cue-induced craving in cigarette smokers.
Methods
Eighty-six non–treatment-seeking, adult smokers (≥10 cigarettes daily) were paid to abstain for 7 (Group 1), 14 (Group 2), or 35 (Groups 3 and 4) days. Abstinence was verified daily. Groups 1, 2, and 3 underwent a single cue session on the final abstinence day (7, 14, or 35). Group 4 viewed cues on Days 7, 14, and 35.
Results
Between and within groups, smoking-cue–induced craving increased with abstinence on some measures. Cue-induced craving was greater in Group 3 (35-day) compared with Group 1 (7-day). Within Group 4, cue-induced craving was greater at 35 than 14 days. Cue-induced craving did not decrease with abstinence on any measure.
Conclusions
We present initial evidence of incubation of cue-induced craving in humans. The observation that cue-induced craving increases with abstinence, even as “background” craving and withdrawal symptoms subside, might have treatment implications.},

This raises the question as to which extent one should utilize social information. One strategy is to make use of uncertainty estimates, leading to a copy-when-uncertain strategy that weights information from individual and social sources based on their respective reliabilities. Here, we investigate this integration process by extending models of Bayes optimal integration of sensory information to a social decision context. We then use a key parameter of our behavioral model in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural substrate that is specifically linked to the fidelity of this integration process. We show that individuals behave near Bayes optimal when integrating two distinct sources of social information but systematically deviate from Bayes optimal choice when integrating individual with social information. This systematic behavioral deviation from optimality is linked to activity of left inferior frontal gyrus. Thus, an ability to optimally exploit social information depends on processes that overcome an egocentric bias, and this regulatory role involves the left inferior prefrontal cortex. The findings provide a mechanistic explanation for observations wherein individuals neglect the benefits from exploiting social information.},

We argue that this model has promise in three distinct areas of research: challenging assumptions, clarifying conceptions, and specifying conditions. We then apply this theoretical framework to a specific puzzle in political science that transcends sub-field distinctions: social norm compliance. We argue that utilizing the social brain paradigm allows us to clarify precisely what social norms are at a physical level, challenge the underlying assumptions of current social norm research, and specify precise and testable conditions of compliance and non-compliance behavior. Ultimately we suggest that the social brain specifically and neuroscience generally offer much promise for political scientists, although scholars must be critical and careful in their justification and application of neuroscientific data.},

In the present study, pairs of participants were asked to rate and communicate the degree of their emotional arousal while viewing affective pictures. Strikingly, participants adjusted their arousal ratings to match up with their interaction partner. In anticipation of the affective picture, the interaction partner’s arousal ratings correlated positively with activity in anterior insula and prefrontal cortex. During picture presentation, social influence was reflected in the ventral striatum, that is, activity in the ventral striatum correlated negatively with the interaction partner’s ratings. Results of the study show that emotional alignment through the influence of another person’s communicated experience has to be considered as a complex phenomenon integrating different components including emotion anticipation and conformity.},

	abstract = {All known human societies have maintained social order by enforcing compliance with social norms. The biological mechanisms underlying norm compliance are, however, hardly understood. We show that the right lateral prefrontal cortex ({rLPFC}) is involved in both voluntary and sanction-induced norm compliance. Both types of compliance could be changed by varying the neural excitability of this brain region with transcranial direct current stimulation, but they were affected in opposite ways, suggesting that the stimulated region plays a fundamentally different role in voluntary and sanction-based compliance. Brain stimulation had a particularly strong effect on compliance in the context of socially constituted sanctions, whereas it left beliefs about what the norm prescribes and about subjectively expected sanctions unaffected. Our findings suggest that {rLPFC} activity is a key biological prerequisite for an evolutionarily and socially important aspect of human behavior.
Conform to the Norm
Human societies have always enforced compliance with norms of acceptable behavior among their members by threatening punishment. It has been proposed that the human brain may have developed neural processes that support norm enforcement behavior and generate appropriate behavioral responses to social punishment threats. However, evidence for the neural circuitry underlying sanction-induced norm compliance in humans is limited. Using noninvasive brain stimulation, Ruff et al. (p. 482, published online 10 October) observed that alteration of the activity and excitability of the right lateral prefrontal cortex affected norm compliance, without affecting awareness of the content of the respective norms, or the expected sanctions. These alterations were much larger in a social, as compared to a nonsocial, context.},

The right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ({rVLPFC}) facilitates self-regulation and plays a robust role in regulating the distress of social rejection. However, recruiting this region’s inhibitory function during social rejection may come at a self-regulatory cost. As supported by prominent theories of self-regulation, we hypothesized that greater {rVLPFC} recruitment during rejection would predict a subsequent self-regulatory imbalance that favored reflexive impulses (i.e., cravings), which would then impair self-regulation. Supporting our hypotheses, {rVLPFC} activation during social rejection was associated with greater subsequent nucleus accumbens ({NAcc}) activation and lesser functional connectivity between the {NAcc} and {rVLPFC} to appetitive cues. Over seven days, the effect of daily felt rejection on daily self-regulatory impairment was exacerbated among participants who showed a stronger {rVLPFC} response to social rejection. This interactive effect was mirrored in the effect of daily felt rejection on heightened daily alcohol cravings. Our findings suggest that social rejection likely impairs self-regulation by recruiting the {rVLPFC}, which then tips the regulatory balance towards reward-based impulses.},

Until this point, however, it is unclear whether this phenomenon of social conformity influences early stages of perception that might not even reach awareness or later stages of conscious decision-making. Using electroencephalography, this study has revealed that social conformity to the wrong group opinion resulted in a decrease of the posterior-lateral P1 in line with a decrease of the later centro-parietal P3.

	abstract = {Summary
In recent years the neuropeptide oxytocin ({OT}) has become one of the most studied peptides of the human neuroendocrine system. Research has shown widespread behavioural effects and numerous potential therapeutic benefits. However, little is known about how {OT} triggers these effects in the brain. Here, we discuss some of the physiological properties of {OT} in the human brain including the long half-life of neuropeptides, the diffuse projections of {OT} throughout the brain and interactions with other systems such as the dopaminergic system. These properties indicate that {OT} acts without clear spatial and temporal specificity. Therefore, it is likely to have widespread effects on the brain's intrinsic functioning. Additionally, we review studies that have used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) concurrently with {OT} administration. These studies reveal a specific set of ‘social’ brain regions that are likely to be the strongest targets for {OT}'s potential to influence human behaviour. On the basis of the {fMRI} literature and the physiological properties of the neuropeptide, we argue that {OT} has the potential to not only modulate activity in a set of specific brain regions, but also the functional connectivity between these regions. In light of the increasing knowledge of the behavioural effects of {OT} in humans, studies of the effects of {OT} administration on brain function can contribute to our understanding of the neural networks in the social brain.},

So far, however, little empirical work has been conducted on social objects and we are still at the very early stages of understanding how the brain permits us to represent, recognize, and constitute a social reality. In this chapter, we consider five core questions for a neuroscience of social objects: Are social objects a category of objects in the brain? When we use money or see it being used, do we employ similar representations as those of concrete tools such as screwdrivers? How do status functions emerge? Do social objects depend on a uniquely human ability to share goals and intentions? Do social objects influence the sensory-motor system? We speculate on ways in which these questions might be addressed combining behavioural, developmental, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging approaches.},

	abstract = {Cultivating social connection has long been a goal of psychology, philosophy, religion, and public policy. Yet the psychological and neural responses that accompany a feeling of connection to others remain unclear. In the present study, we used functional neuroimaging to shed light on the neural correlates of self- and other-focused processes during the successful self-generation of feelings of social connection. To do this, we used a trait judgment task to localize functional activation related to self-focused thought. We then examined brain responses during guided exercises designed both to encourage feeling love and connection from others (i.e., self-focused) and to generate feelings of love and connection toward others (i.e., other-focused). Our results indicated that generating feelings of social connection recruited a portion of the medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}) implicated in thinking about both the self and others. Within this larger area, we observed distinct profiles of activation within different subregions. Although rostral anterior cingulate cortex was more strongly activated by other-focused components of the task, a more dorsal portion of {MPFC} was comparatively more active during primarily self-focused components of the task. Somewhat surprisingly, stronger feelings of social connection were not associated with greater activation in the anterior cingulate, but rather with less activation in the dorsal region of the {MPFC} related to self-focused thought. These results are consistent with the possibility that reducing certain kinds of self-focused thought might yield a greater sense of social connection to and care for others.},

The responder can accept or reject the deal. If the deal is rejected, neither player gets anything. The rational solution, suggested by game theory, is for the proposer to offer the smallest possible share and for the responder to accept it. If humans play the game, however, the most frequent outcome is a fair share. In this paper, we develop an evolutionary approach to the Ultimatum Game. We show that fairness will evolve if the proposer can obtain some information on what deals the responder has accepted in the past. Hence, the evolution of fairness, similarly to the evolution of cooperation, is linked to reputation.},

To investigate the reliability of task-related deactivations, we performed a meta-analysis across 12 {fMRI} studies. Our results replicate previous findings by implicating medial frontal and parietal brain regions as part of the “default system”.

However, the cognitive correlates of these deactivations remain unclear. In light of the importance of social cognitive abilities for human beings and their propensity to engage in such activities, we relate our results to findings from neuroimaging studies of social cognition. This demonstrates a remarkable overlap between the brain regions typically involved in social cognitive processes and the “default system”.

We, henceforth, suggest that the physiological ‘baseline’ of the brain is intimately linked to a psychological ‘baseline’: human beings have a predisposition for social cognition as the default mode of cognizing which is implemented in the robust pattern of intrinsic brain activity known as the “default system”.},

The S populations sampled included naturally occurring discussion groups (of undergraduates), 37 married couples, 74 female and 84 male players on intercollegiate basketball teams, and groups of undergraduates assembled in the laboratory. Data provide consistent evidence for egocentric biases in availability and attribution: The S's own contributions to a joint product were more readily available, i.e., more frequently and easily recalled, and Ss accepted more responsibility for a group product than other participants attributed to them. In addition, statements attributed to the self were recalled more accurately and the availability bias was attenuated, though not eliminated, when the group product was negatively evaluated. When another S's contributions were made more available to the S via a selective retrieval process, this S allocated correspondingly more responsibility for the group decisions to the coparticipant. The determinants and pervasiveness of the egocentric biases are considered. (27 ref)},

Reward processing can thus be dissected into a phase of reward anticipation and a phase of reward consumption. A number of brain structures have been suggested to be involved in reward processing. However, it is unclear whether anticipation and consumption are mediated by the same or different neural networks. We examined the neural basis of these processes using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) in an incentive delay task offering either money or social approval. In both conditions participants (N = 28) were given a cue indicating potential reward. In order to receive reward a target button had to be pushed within a certain time window (adapted for individual reaction time). Cues triggering either monetary or social reward anticipation were presented sessionwise. Imaging was performed on a 1.5-Tesla Philips scanner in an event-related design. Anticipation of both reward types activated brain structures constituting the brain reward system including the ventral striatum. In contrast to the task independent activity in the anticipation phase, reward consumption evoked different patterns of activation for money and social approval, respectively. While social stimuli were mainly associated with amygdala activation, the thalamus was more strongly activated by the presentation of monetary rewards. Our results identify dissociable neural networks for the anticipation and consumption of reward. The findings implicate that the neural mechanisms underlying reward consumption are more modality-specific than those for reward anticipation, and that they are mediated by subjective reward value.},

One such trait, strong reciprocity is a predisposition to cooperate with others and to punish those who violate the norms of cooperation, at personal cost, even when it is implausible to expect that these costs will be repaid. We present evidence supporting strong reciprocity as a schema for predicting and understanding altruism in humans. We show that under conditions plausibly characteristic of the early stages of human evolution, a small number of strong reciprocators could invade a population of self-regarding types, and strong reciprocity is an evolutionary stable strategy. Although most of the evidence we report is based on behavioral experiments, the same behaviors are regularly described in everyday life, for example, in wage setting by firms, tax compliance, and cooperation in the protection of local environmental public goods.},

	abstract = {A growing body of research has emerged on online product reviews and their ability to elicit performance outcomes desired by retailers; yet, a common understanding of the performance implications of online product reviews has eluded us. Scholars continue to navigate an array of studies assessing different design elements of online product reviews, and various research settings and data sources. We undertake a meta-analysis of 26 empirical studies yielding 443 sales elasticities to examine how these variables relate to retail sales. Building on well-established meta-analytical methods, we address the following questions: How does review valence influence the elasticity of retailer sales? What about review volume? For which product types and usage situations do online product reviews have a greater impact on retailer sales elasticity? Which types of online reviewers and websites exert the greatest influence on retailer sales elasticity? Our study answers these important questions and provides a much needed quantitative synthesis of this burgeoning stream of research.},

This functional overlap would be expected if humans use their own experiences to infer the mental states of others, a basic postulate of simulation theory. Neural activity was measured while participants attended to either the mental or physical aspects of a series of other people. To permit a test of simulation theory's prediction that inferences based on self-reflection should only be made for similar others, targets were subsequently rated for their degree of similarity to self. Parametric analyses revealed a region of the ventral {mPFC}—previously implicated in self-referencing tasks—in which activity correlated with perceived self/other similarity, but only for mentalizing trials. These results suggest that self-reflection may be used to infer the mental states of others when they are sufficiently similar to self.},

The authors test whether this “strength of weak ties” generalizes from simple to complex contagions. Complex contagions require social affirmation from multiple sources. Examples include the spread of high‐risk social movements, avant garde fashions, and unproven technologies. Results show that as adoption thresholds increase, long ties can impede diffusion. Complex contagions depend primarily on the width of the bridges across a network, not just their length. Wide bridges are a characteristic feature of many spatial networks, which may account in part for the widely observed tendency for social movements to diffuse spatially.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

Whereas the neurobehavioral bases of environment-induced drug taking has been investigated with animal models, the influence of drug-environments on brain function and behavior in clinical populations of substance users is largely unexplored. Adult smokers (n=40) photographed locations personally associated with smoking (personal smoking environments; {PSEs}) or not smoking ({PNEs}). Following 24-h abstinence, participants underwent {fMRI} scanning while viewing {PSEs}, {PNEs}, standard smoking and nonsmoking environments, as well as proximal smoking (eg lit cigarette) and nonsmoking (eg pencil) cues. Finally, in two separate sessions following 6-h abstinence they viewed either {PSEs} or {PNEs} while cue-induced self-reported craving and smoking behavior were assessed. Viewing {PSEs} increased {BOLD} signal in right posterior hippocampus ({pHPC}; F2,685=3.74, p{\textless}0.024) and bilateral insula (left: F2,685=6.87, p=0.0011; right: F2,685=5.34, p=0.005). In the laboratory, viewing {PSEs}, compared to {PNEs}, was associated with higher craving levels (F2,180=18.32, p{\textless}0.0001) and greater ad lib smoking (F1,36=5.01, p=0.032). The effect of {PSEs} (minus {PNEs}) on brain activation in right insula was positively correlated with the effect of {PSEs} (minus {PNEs}) on number of puffs taken from a cigarette (r=0.6, p=0.001). Our data, for the first time in humans, elucidates the neural mechanisms that mediate the effects of real-world drug-associated environments on drug taking behavior under conditions of drug abstinence.

Seventy-two smokers used digital cameras to take pictures of the environments in which they do and do not smoke. They then completed a cue-reactivity session during which they viewed and rated pictures of smoking and nonsmoking environments, half personal and half standard, all devoid of proximal smoking cues. As hypothesized, personal environments led to a significantly larger smoking–nonsmoking difference in craving, compared with the standard environments. Personalization also enhanced stimuli vividness, relevance, positive affect, and excitement, as well as heart rate changes from baseline. Implications of these findings for exposure-based research and treatment for addiction, as well as other psychological disorders, are discussed.},

The amounts of nicotine inhaled by passive smoking in various living environments were estimated to be in the range of 0.9–40 μg/hr.

Less is known about the role of environmental contexts in human drug-dependence research. Traditionally, cue-based studies and treatments focus on conditioned cues most proximal to drug administration (e.g., lit cigarettes, pictorial stimuli of drug paraphernalia). However, there is reason to believe that more distal cues, such as the environments in which drugs were previously used, might similarly gain associative control over human responding. This article describes a body of systematic research aimed at identifying and studying the impact of environmental contexts on smokers' cue reactivity in the laboratory. Overall, results of this program of research demonstrate that exposure to environments associated with smoking, but completely devoid of proximal smoking cues, can function as conditioned stimuli capable of evoking strong subjective responding from abstinent smokers. Furthermore, more robust reactivity can be achieved if environmental context cues are personalized using novel techniques described in this article.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.11.043},
	abstract = {Multi-voxel pattern analysis ({MVPA}) is a fruitful and increasingly popular complement to traditional univariate methods of analyzing neuroimaging data. We propose to replace the standard 'decoding' approach to searchlight-based {MVPA}, measuring the performance of a classifier by its accuracy, with a method based on the multivariate form of the general linear model. Following the well-established methodology of multivariate analysis of variance ({MANOVA}), we define a measure that directly characterizes the structure of multi-voxel data, the pattern distinctness D. Our measure is related to standard multivariate statistics, but we apply cross-validation to obtain an unbiased estimate of its population value, independent of the amount of data or its partitioning into 'training' and 'test' sets. The estimate D{\textasciicircum} can therefore serve not only as a test statistic, but also as an interpretable measure of multivariate effect size. The pattern distinctness generalizes the Mahalanobis distance to an arbitrary number of classes, but also the case where there are no classes of trials because the design is described by parametric regressors. It is defined for arbitrary estimable contrasts, including main effects (pattern differences) and interactions (pattern changes). In this way, our approach makes the full analytical power of complex factorial designs known from univariate {fMRI} analyses available to {MVPA} studies. Moreover, we show how the results of a factorial analysis can be used to obtain a measure of pattern stability, the equivalent of 'cross-decoding'.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The {PROMIS} Smoking Initiative has developed six item banks for assessment related to cigarette smoking among adult smokers (Nicotine Dependence, Coping Expectancies, Emotional and Sensory Expectancies, Health Expectancies, Psychosocial Expectancies, and Social Motivations). This article evaluates the psychometric performance of the banks when administered via short form ({SF}), computer adaptive test ({CAT}), and by mode of administration (computer vs. paper-and-pencil).
Methods: Data are from two sources: an internet sample (N = 491) of daily and nondaily smokers who completed both {SFs} and {CATs} via the web and a community sample (N = 369) that completed either paper-and-pencil or computer administration of the {SFs} at two time points. First a {CAT} version of the {PROMIS} Smoking Assessment Toolkit was evaluated by comparing item administration rates and scores to the {SF} administration. Next, we considered the effect of computer versus paper-and-pencil administration on scoring and test-retest reliability.
Results: Across the domains approximately 5.4 to 10.3 items were administered on average for the {CAT}. {SF} and {CAT} item response theory-scores were correlated from 0.82 to 0.92 across the domains. Cronbach’s alpha for the four- to eight-item {SFs} among daily smokers ranged from .80 to .91 and .82 to .91 for paper-and-pencil and computer administrations, respectively. Test-retest reliability of the {SFs} ranged from 0.79 to 0.89 across mode of administration.
Conclusions: Results indicate that the {SF} and {CAT} and computer and paper-and-pencil administrations provide highly comparable scores for daily and nondaily smokers, but preference for {SF} or {CAT} administration may vary by smoking domain.},

Here, we report that the human-perceived positivity of over 10,000 of the most frequently used English words exhibits a clear positive bias.

	abstract = {During narrative comprehension, readers understand the emotions of the protagonist by taking the perspective of the character, which is an essential component of empathy. Spatial perspective-taking is crucial to understanding the standpoints and perceptions of others, and gives clues as to what the protagonist knows. As a default, a “here and now” point-of-view is adopted to make sense of the narrative. If the protagonist is in a different location while an event takes place (“there and now”), in order to comprehend the narrative the reader must take an allocentric perspective, which places greater demands on spatial perspective-taking. Utilizing this phenomenon, we evaluated the neural substrates of perspective-taking in emotional narrative comprehension using functional {MRI} in 18 normal adults. The subjects read short stories followed by a target sentence, which described an event that might evoke an emotional response in the protagonist if the character were present. The stories involved a scenario in which the character was either present at the same location (“here and now”) or at a distant location (“there and now”) during the event. The “there and now” scenario activated the posterior cingulate cortex and the right temporo-parietal junction more prominently than the “here and now” condition. In contrast to the control tasks, both scenarios activated the well-known mentalizing network including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, temporal pole, posterior cingulate cortex and temporo-parietal junction. Along with the mentalizing network, the posterior cingulate cortex and the right temporo-parietal junction are involved in spatial perspective-taking during emotional narrative comprehension.},

As anticipated, a perceived threat to freedom was positively associated with state reactance, which in turn was positively associated with a boomerang effect and negatively associated with favorable source appraisal. State reactance was not associated with favorable attitudes toward preventing the overconsumption of alcohol. In addition to main effects, interactions between message frame and efficacy appeal with four person factors (participant age, trait reactance, perceived health risk, and alcohol consumption) were examined. Individuals perceiving health risk to be low would benefit from gain-frame messages, whereas loss-frame messages would be most effective for heavy drinkers. Finally, when communicating to underage drinkers, our results support using efficacy appeals when accompanied by a loss-frame message.},

Experiment 1 demonstrated that readers embody an actor's perspective when the pronoun you or I is used, but take an external perspective when he is used. Experiment 2, however, found that a short discourse context preceding the event sentence led readers to adopt an external perspective with the pronoun I. These experiments demonstrate that pronoun variation and discourse context mediate the degree of embodiment experienced during narrative comprehension: In all cases, readers mentally simulate objects and events, but they embody an actor's perspective only when directly addressed as the subject of a sentence.},

Results revealed that when the risk associated with a health behaviour (either a prevention behaviour in Experiment 1 or a detection behaviour in Experiment 2) was low, participants responded more favourably to gain-framed messages.

In evaluating the effectiveness of framed health messages, investigators must appreciate the context in which health-related decisions are made. The influence of framed information on decision making is contingent on people, first, internalizing the advocated frame and, then, on the degree to which performing a health behavior is perceived as risky. The relative effectiveness of gain-framed or loss-framed appeals depends, in part, on whether a behavior serves as an illness-detecting or a health-affirming function.

When people consider these messages from the perspective of the individuals described in them, they often imagine the reactions they would have if they personally experienced the situation described. When this occurs, they are likely to be influenced by the messages independently of the protagonists’ characteristics. When recipients’ attention is drawn to themselves, however, they compare themselves with the protagonists to determine whether the protagonists’ actions or the situation described in the message have implications for their own behavior. This self-focused attention increases the impact of the message when they are similar to the protagonists, decreases its impact when they are moderately dissimilar, and has no effect at all when they are very dissimilar to the protagonists. Two experiments, in which participants’ self-focused attention, the type of persuasive appeal (self-referential vs. impersonal), and protagonist-participant similarity were independently manipulated, confirmed these effects on the impact of both (a) an appeal for monetary donations to a charity and (b) a commercial advertisement.},

Our evidence also suggests that one trait—Openness—is associated with broad persuasibility, while others shape responses to particular types of messages. In some cases the conditioning effects of Big Five traits are substantial. For example, in the one-voter households ({HHs}) included in our field experiment, we find that a mailer that raised the specter of social sanctions increased the likelihood of voting by a statistically greater amount among those scoring high on Openness.

	abstract = {Tailored health communication ({THC}) is any combination of information and behavior change strategies intended to reach one specific person based on information unique to that person, related to the outcome of interest, and derived from an individual assessment. {THCs} have been studied as a means to facilitate behavior change by influencing some key intermediate steps that precede the behavioral outcome. These include the extent to which people attend to communications, think about them, find them relevant and salient, and intend to take action. Evidence shows that {THCs} have achieved modest success in changing a number of cancer-related behaviors, including smoking, diet, exercise, and cancer screening. However, it is likely that {THCs} could be more effective if they were developed with a greater understanding of message effects and what we refer to as the behavioral pathway. Instead of using unidimensional approaches to influence behavior change, a message effects approach would help researchers identify key leverage points for impact on such intermediate outcomes as persuasion and yielding. Such a strategy also might be used to determine when {THCs} are the preferred approach and when generic, targeted, or combinations of {THCs} and targeted communications might be appropriate. Viewing {THCs} from the perspective of the behavioral pathway might indicate use of different messages, sources, and formats to influence different people at different points on the pathway. We provide a brief history of {THCs} and suggest how integrating a broader perspective of health behavior and health communication theories could enrich {THCs}.},

	abstract = {Medical Education 2011: 45: 818–826 Context  The Association of American Medical Colleges’ Institute for Improving Medical Education’s report entitled ‘Effective Use of Educational Technology’ called on researchers to study the effectiveness of multimedia design principles. These principles were empirically shown to result in superior learning when used with college students in laboratory studies, but have not been studied with undergraduate medical students as participants. Methods  A pre-test/post-test control group design was used, in which the traditional-learning group received a lecture on shock using traditionally designed slides and the modified-design group received the same lecture using slides modified in accord with Mayer’s principles of multimedia design. Participants included Year 3 medical students at a private, midwestern medical school progressing through their surgery clerkship during the academic year 2009–2010. The medical school divides students into four groups; each group attends the surgery clerkship during one of the four quarters of the academic year. Students in the second and third quarters served as the modified-design group (n = 91) and students in the fourth-quarter clerkship served as the traditional-design group (n = 39). Results  Both student cohorts had similar levels of pre-lecture knowledge. Both groups showed significant improvements in retention (p {\textless} 0.0001), transfer (p {\textless} 0.05) and total scores (p {\textless} 0.0001) between the pre- and post-tests. Repeated-measures anova analysis showed statistically significant greater improvements in retention (F = 10.2, p = 0.0016) and total scores (F = 7.13, p = 0.0081) for those students instructed using principles of multimedia design compared with those instructed using the traditional design. Conclusions  Multimedia design principles are easy to implement and result in improved short-term retention among medical students, but empirical research is still needed to determine how these principles affect transfer of learning. Further research on applying the principles of multimedia design to medical education is needed to verify the impact it has on the long-term learning of medical students, as well as its impact on other forms of multimedia instructional programmes used in the education of medical students.},

	shorttitle = {Effects of Functional Interactivity on Patients’ Knowledge, Empowerment, and Health Outcomes},
	abstract = {Background
The effectiveness of {eHealth} interventions in terms of reach and outcomes is now well documented. However, there is a need to understand not only whether {eHealth} interventions work, but also what kind of functions and mechanisms enhance their effectiveness. The present investigation contributes to tackling these challenges by investigating the role played by functional interactivity on patients’ knowledge, empowerment, and health outcomes.

Objectives
To test whether health knowledge and empowerment mediate a possible relationship between the availability of interactive features on an {eHealth} application and individuals’ health outcomes. We present an empirical, model-driven evaluation of the effects of functional interactivity implemented in an {eHealth} application, based on a brief theoretical review of the constructs of interactivity, health knowledge, empowerment, and health outcomes. We merged these constructs into a theoretical model of interactivity effects that we tested on an {eHealth} application for patients with fibromyalgia syndrome ({FMS}).

Methods
This study used a pretest–posttest experimental design. We recruited 165 patients and randomly assigned them to three study groups, corresponding to different levels of functional interactivity. Eligibility to participate in the study required that patients (1) be fluent in Italian, (2) have access to the Internet, (3) report confidence in how to use a computer, and (4) have received a diagnosis of {FMS} from a doctor. We used structural equation modeling techniques to analyze changes between the pretest and the posttest results.

Results
The main finding was that functional interactivity had no impact on empowerment dimensions, nor direct observable effects on knowledge. However, knowledge positively affected health outcomes (b = –.12, P = .02), as did the empowerment dimensions of meaning (b = –.49, P {\textless} .001) and impact (b = –.25, P {\textless} .001).

Conclusion
The theoretical model was partially confirmed, but only as far as the effects of knowledge and empowerment were concerned. The differential effect of interactive functions was by far weaker than expected. The strong impact of knowledge and empowerment on health outcomes suggests that these constructs should be targeted and enhanced by {eHealth} applications.},

The perceived relative advantage of the Internet over other media is its cost-effectiveness and interactivity, which in turn contribute to its persuasive capabilities. Ironically, despite its potential, we are nowhere nearer understanding how interactivity affects processing of health information and its contribution in terms of health outcomes. An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of Web interactivity on comprehension of and attitudes towards two health Web sites, and whether individual differences might moderate such effects. Two sites on skin cancer were designed with different levels of interactivity and randomly assigned to 441 undergraduate students (aged 18–26) at a large southeastern university. The findings suggest that interactivity can significantly affect comprehension as well as attitudes towards health Web sites.

It exposes the tautology of studying the effects of perceived interactivity and calls for the consideration of ontological aspects that constitute interactivity while specifying its social and psychological effects. Theoretical explorations may be categorized in terms of three classes of outcome measures—behavioral, attitudinal, and cognitive—as we investigate the role played by interactivity in initiating action, changing attitudes, and altering the nature of information processing. These would result in theories about technology rather than psychology in that they help us specify direct and combination effects of interactivity, modality, navigability, and other technological attributes of the Web medium.},

	abstract = {This article examines how everyday media use and interpersonal communication for health information could influence health behaviors beyond intervention or campaign contexts. The authors argue that interpersonal communication works as an independent information channel and mediates the relation between media channels and health behaviors. In addition, the authors investigate whether interpersonal communication differently influences the relation between media connections and health behaviors for more and less educated individuals. Using data from the 2008 Annenberg National Health Communication Survey, the authors show that multiple communication channels for health information encourage health-enhancing behaviors but do not have significant relations with health-threatening behaviors. Interpersonal communication is directly linked to health-enhancing behaviors, but it also mediates the influence of individuals' multichannel media environment on health-enhancing behaviors. The mediating role of interpersonal health communication was only significant for less educated people. In addition, among media channels, television was a more important instigator of health-related conversations with family and friends for the less educated group. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings, as well as suggestions for future research directions, are discussed.},

Based on Zaller’s theory of public opinion dynamics, for less politically sophisticated individuals, we expected media to influence changes in opinion under the condition of a one-sided message flow. We further expected politically sophisticated individuals to rely more on cues for opinion change stemming from interpersonal communication. The study draws on two-wave panel surveys and media content analyses of television news and national newspapers. The results confirmed our hypotheses and showed media effects for less politically sophisticated individuals under the condition of a one-sided message flow and effects of interpersonal communication for politically sophisticated individuals. Media had no effect under the condition of a two-sided message flow.

Researchers have identified numerous personal and situational factors that moderate the extent to which people display the bias. It is unclear, however, whether these moderators affect the bias by influencing people's personal risk estimates or their risk estimates for a target. A review of moderators of the optimistic bias reveals evidence for both influences. Moderators associated with negative affect (negative mood, dysphoria, trait and state anxiety, event severity, and proximity of feedback) and control related moderators (perceived control and prior experience) appear primarily to affect personal risk estimates. Positive mood affects target risk estimates. Finally, moderators that surround the comparison process appear to have different effects. Specifically, the type of comparison target appears to affect target risk estimates, whereas attention to personal risk-related behaviors affects personal risk estimates.},

They describe a model in which mindfulness training leads to a fundamental change in relationship to experience (reperceiving), which leads to changes in self-regulation, values clarification, cognitive and behavioral flexibility, and exposure. These four variables, in turn, result in salutogenic outcomes. Analyses of responses from participants in a mindfulness-based stress-reduction program did not support the mediating effect of changes in reperceiving on the relationship of mindfulness with those four variables. However, when mindfulness and reperceiving scores were combined, partial support was found for the mediating effect of the four variables on measures of psychological distress. Issues arising in attempts to test the proposed theory are discussed, including the description of the model variables and the challenges to their assessment. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The development of self-recognition has been studied mainly by examining infants' responses to their reflections in mirrors. The definitive test is whether or not the infant is capable of using the reflection to notice and respond to a mark on the face or head by touching the mark. The mark should be inconspicuous to the infant not looking in a mirror. In general, studies agree that this response appears in some infants around 15 months of age and is shown by a majority of infants by 24 months of age. There is less agreement over the existence of a “withdrawal” component in the second year, or the presence of a “social” phase analogous to the reaction of many animals confronted with a mirror. Infants as young as 3 months are differentially responsive to a self-reflection and a live peer. Various “self-conscious” reactions and self-labelling may also indicate self-recognition in the second year, but their validity is not well established. Studies using videotapes of the self and others show that contingency of mevement is a salient cue which is learned early, and that attempts to engage in contingent play and to imitate representations of oneself are useful measures of early self-recognition. The validity of the response of turning to look at an object first seen in a mirror as a sign of self-recognition is questioned. The age at which self-recognition in still pictures first appears is less clear. Verbal comprehension of self-relevant labels appears earlier than active self-labelling. A few studies have addressed the question of cognitive correlates of self-recognition, but a variety of behaviors that imply self-awareness and the corrresponding ability to impute mental states to others remains to be studied in relation to self-recognition. Continued research into self-recognition and associated abilities in nonhuman primates enhances the overall understanding of the development of self-awareness.},

The taste of sucrose elicited homologous positive hedonic patterns of facial affective reactions from humans and other primates, whereas quinine elicited homologous aversive or negative affective patterns. The degree of similarity between human and other primate affective reaction patterns appeared to be strongly indicative of their phylogenetic relatedness. For example, affective reaction patterns of human infants and great apes were more similar to each other than either were to Old World monkeys or New World monkeys. Certain affective reaction components were found to be shared by humans and all primates, whereas other components were restricted to particular taxonomic groups. Finally, allometric timing parameters for the duration of components indicated that the ‘same’ affective reaction could have different durations in species of different size. These results show that both positive/negative valence and intensity of affective reaction may be quantitatively assessed in human and non-human primates, and indicate that taste-elicited affective reaction patterns of human infants are related systematically to those of other primate species.},

Ten studies assessed the role of implicit egotism in 2 major life decisions: where people choose to live and what people choose to do for a living. Studies 1-5 showed that people are disproportionately likely to live in places whose names resemble their own first or last names (e.g., people named Louis are disproportionately likely to live in St. Louis). Study 6 extended this finding to birthday number preferences. People were disproportionately likely to live in cities whose names began with their birthday numbers (e.g., Two Harbors, {MN}). Studies 7-10 suggested that people disproportionately choose careers whose labels resemble their names (e.g., people named Dennis or Denise are overrepresented among dentists). Implicit egotism appears to influence major life decisions. This idea stands in sharp contrast to many models of rational choice and attests to the importance of understanding implicit beliefs.},

Results demonstrate that the {TRA} and {TPB} both exhibited good fit with the corrected correlation matrices, but the {TPB} accounted for more variance in physical activity intentions and behavior. Self-efficacy explained unique variance in intention, and the inclusion of past behavior in the model resulted in the attenuation of the intention-behavior, attitude-intention, self-efficacy-intention, and self-efficacy-behavior relationships. There was some evidence that the study relationships were moderated by attitude-intention strength and age, but there was a lack of homogeneity in the moderator groups.

Finally, Study 5 shows that the {BTA} effect increases in magnitude after participants experience a threat to their feelings of self-worth.

The {BTAE} has been demonstrated in many populations with various methodologies, and several explanations have been advanced for it. Two essential questions remain conspicuously unanswered in the {BTAE} literature. The first concerns the extent to which the {BTAE} can be represented as a social-comparative phenomenon, and the second concerns the role that strategic motivational processes play in self versus average-peer judgments. With regard to the first question, Study 1 provides direct experimental evidence that self versus average-peer judgments are made relationally rather than independently and, further, that self-ratings anchor these relational judgments. Moreover, Study 1 demonstrates that the consequence of this comparison is for judgments of average to be assimilated toward, not contrasted from, self-ratings. Studies 2–4 provide evidence that self-enhancement motives play a moderating role in the outcome of self versus average-peer judgments. We show that for dimensions on which the self is positively evaluated, enhancement motives restrict the extent to which average-peer assimilation occurs (Study 2). But for dimensions on which the self is negatively evaluated, enhancement motives amplify average-peer assimilation (Studies 3 and 4). Discussion focuses on the function of such differential assimilation, the relation of the current findings to extant perspectives, and directions for future research.},

Desirability of presumed message influence, vulnerability of referent others, referent others depicted as being similar to self, and others being likely audience of the media content in question are significant moderators.

The effect is also more situationally specific than originally believed, as illustrated by evidence of first-person effects in response to socially desirable messages. Self-enhancement biases, although not the only processes that underlie the effect, provide a parsimonious explanation of message-desirability recruits. Other delimiting conditions such as social distance are critically reviewed, evidence for behavioral effects is discussed, and methodological shortcomings are noted. Six directions for research are articulated.},

Thirty-two published and unpublished studies with 121 separate effect sizes were examined. The overall effect size between estimated media effects on self and on others was r = .50. Among the 8 moderators investigated (source, method, sampling, respondent, country, desirability, medium, and message), 3 (sampling, respondent, and message) yielded significant effect size variations. Third-person perception in nonrandom and college student samples was significantly larger than in random and noncollege student samples. From a theoretical perspective, these findings may have been due to student participants perceiving themselves to be smarter than other people.

This review focuses on cigarette smoking, weight control, contraception, alcohol abuse and exercise behaviors. The studies reviewed suggest strong relationships between self-efficacy and health behavior change and maintenance. Experimental manipulations of self-efficacy suggest that efficacy can be enhanced and that this enhancement is related to subsequent health behavior change. The findings from these studies also suggest methods for modifying health practices. These methods diverge from many of the current, traditional methods for changing health practices.

The relationship between {SE} and future smoking was modest when {SE} was assessed prior to a quit attempt; {SE} scores were .21 standard deviation units ({SD}) higher for those not smoking at follow-up than for those who were smoking.

Events that threaten self-integrity arouse stress and self-protective defenses that can hamper performance and growth. However, an intervention known as self-affirmation can curb these negative outcomes. Self-affirmation interventions typically have people write about core personal values. The interventions bring about a more expansive view of the self and its resources, weakening the implications of a threat for personal integrity. Timely affirmations have been shown to improve education, health, and relationship outcomes, with benefits that sometimes persist for months and years. Like other interventions and experiences, self-affirmations can have lasting benefits when they touch off a cycle of adaptive potential, a positive feedback loop between the self-system and the social system that propagates adaptive outcomes over time.

	abstract = {Objective: The present study aimed to quantify the magnitude of the effect of self-affirmation manipulations on health messages’ influence on both intentions and behavior. Methods: A systematic search was conducted for experimental studies comparing participants who self-affirmed prior to reading a threatening health message to those who did not self-affirm. Effect sizes for health intentions and behaviors were aggregated using a random-effects model. Results: Data from 16 studies were included. The aggregate effect sizes for intentions and behavior were significant and small in magnitude (d+ = .26, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = .04–.48; d+ = .27, 95\% {CI} = .11–.43, respectively). A meta-regression analysis revealed that among studies assessing both outcomes, the size of an effect on intentions did not predict the size of an effect on behavior, β = .03, 95\% {CI} = −.30–.36. Type of health behavior (damaging vs. promoting), timing of the health behavior (proximal vs. distal), type of self-affirmation manipulation (values vs. kindness), and the specificity of the health message (single vs. multiple health issues) did not moderate the effect of self-affirmation on intentions or behavior. Conclusions: Self-affirmation influences health messages’ effect on intentions and behavior; however, with the present study finding that intention effect sizes did not predict behavior effect sizes, and with past studies of heath behavior change finding that intentions do not always translate to behavior, little research supports a causal intention-behavior relation among self-affirmation studies. Future research is needed to address which specific health-related responses explain why self-affirmation elicits health behavior change.},

	abstract = {There appears to be general agreement among social psychologists that most human behavior is goal-directed (e. g., Heider, 1958 ; Lewin, 1951). Being neither capricious nor frivolous, human social behavior can best be described as following along lines of more or less well-formulated plans. Before attending a concert, for example, a person may extend an invitation to a date, purchase tickets, change into proper attire, call a cab, collect the date, and proceed to the concert hall. Most, if not all, of these activities will have been designed in advance; their execution occurs as the plan unfolds. To be sure, a certain sequence of actions can become so habitual or routine that it is performed almost automatically, as in the case of driving from home to work or playing the piano. Highly developed skills of this kind typically no longer require conscious formulation of a behavioral plan. Nevertheless, at least in general outline, we are normally well aware of the actions required to attain a certain goal. Consider such a relatively routine behavior as typing a letter. When setting this activity as a goal, we anticipate the need to locate a typewriter, insert a sheet of paper, adjust the margins, formulate words and sentences, strike the appropriate keys, and so forth. Some parts of the plan are more routine, and require less conscious thought than others, but without an explicit or implicit plan to guide the required sequence of acts, no letter would get typed.},

In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

Incentive to behave (health motivation) is also a component of the model. Locus of control is not included explicitly because it is believed to be incorporated within other elements of the model.

Many people spend a significant amount of time listening to music, and its emotional power is assumed but not well understood. Here, we use functional and effective connectivity analyses to show for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing including the nucleus accumbens ({NAc}) and the ventral tegmental area ({VTA}), as well as the hypothalamus and insula, which are thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli. Responses in the {NAc} and the {VTA} were strongly correlated pointing to an association between dopamine release and {NAc} response to music. Responses in the {NAc} and the hypothalamus were also strongly correlated across subjects, suggesting a mechanism by which listening to pleasant music evokes physiological reactions. Effective connectivity confirmed these findings, and showed significant {VTA}-mediated interaction of the {NAc} with the hypothalamus, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. The enhanced functional and effective connectivity between brain regions mediating reward, autonomic, and cognitive processing provides insight into understanding why listening to music is one of the most rewarding and pleasurable human experiences.},

	abstract = {Anticipated reward magnitude and probability comprise dual components of expected value ({EV}), a cornerstone of economic and psychological theory. However, the neural mechanisms that compute {EV} have not been characterized. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined neural activation as subjects anticipated monetary gains and losses that varied in magnitude and probability. Group analyses indicated that, although the subcortical nucleus accumbens ({NAcc}) activated proportional to anticipated gain magnitude, the cortical mesial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}) additionally activated according to anticipated gain probability. Individual difference analyses indicated that, although {NAcc} activation correlated with self-reported positive arousal, {MPFC} activation correlated with probability estimates. These findings suggest that mesolimbic brain regions support the computation of {EV} in an ascending and distributed manner: whereas subcortical regions represent an affective component, cortical regions also represent a probabilistic component, and, furthermore, may integrate the two.},

	abstract = {Using a multiround version of an economic exchange (trust game), we report that reciprocity expressed by one player strongly predicts future trust expressed by their partner—a behavioral finding mirrored by neural responses in the dorsal striatum. Here, analyses within and between brains revealed two signals—one encoded by response magnitude, and the other by response timing. Response magnitude correlated with the “intention to trust” on the next play of the game, and the peak of these “intention to trust” responses shifted its time of occurrence by 14 seconds as player reputations developed. This temporal transfer resembles a similar shift of reward prediction errors common to reinforcement learning models, but in the context of a social exchange. These data extend previous model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging studies into the social domain and broaden our view of the spectrum of functions implemented by the dorsal striatum.},

	abstract = {The cortical areas that represent affectively positive and negative aspects of touch were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) by comparing activations produced by pleasant touch, painful touch produced by a stylus, and neutral touch, to the left hand. It was found that regions of the orbitofrontal cortex were activated more by pleasant touch and by painful stimuli than by neutral touch and that different areas of the orbitofrontal cortex were activated by the pleasant and painful touches. The orbitofrontal cortex activation was related to the affective aspects of the touch, in that the somatosensory cortex ({SI}) was less activated by the pleasant and painful stimuli than by the neutral stimuli. This dissociation was highly significant for both the pleasant touch (P {\textless} 0.006) and for the painful stimulus (P {\textless} 0.02). Further, it was found that a rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex was activated by the pleasant stimulus and that a more posterior and dorsal part was activated by the painful stimulus. Regions of the somatosensory cortex, including {SI} and part of {SII} in the mid-insula, were activated more by the neutral touch than by the pleasant and painful stimuli. Part of the posterior insula was activated only in the pain condition and different parts of the brainstem, including the central grey, were activated in the pain, pleasant and neutral touch conditions. The results provide evidence that different areas of the human orbitofrontal cortex are involved in representing both pleasant touch and pain, and that dissociable parts of the cingulate cortex are involved in representing pleasant touch and pain.},

	abstract = {Previous research, involving monetary rewards, found that limbic reward-related areas show greater activity when an intertemporal choice includes an immediate reward than when the options include only delayed rewards. In contrast, the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortex (areas commonly associated with deliberative cognitive processes, including future planning) respond to intertemporal choices in general but do not exhibit sensitivity to immediacy ({McClure} et al., 2004). The current experiments extend these findings to primary rewards (fruit juice or water) and time delays of minutes instead of weeks. Thirsty subjects choose between small volumes of drinks delivered at precise times during the experiment (e.g., 2 ml now vs 3 ml in 5 min). Consistent with previous findings, limbic activation was greater for choices between an immediate reward and a delayed reward than for choices between two delayed rewards, whereas the lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex responded similarly whether choices were between an immediate and a delayed reward or between two delayed rewards. Moreover, relative activation of the two sets of brain regions predicts actual choice behavior. A second experiment finds that when the delivery of all rewards is offset by 10 min (so that the earliest available juice reward in any choice is 10 min), no differential activity is observed in limbic reward-related areas for choices involving the earliest versus only more delayed rewards. We discuss implications of this finding for differences between primary and secondary rewards.},

In this {fMRI} investigation we report a significant correlation between the activation of a region of the human orbitofrontal cortex and the decrease in subjective pleasantness when a liquid food is eaten to satiety. Moreover, a cluster of voxels in the orbitofrontal cortex showed a decrease in its activation that was specific to the particular liquid food consumed in a meal, providing a neural correlate of sensory-specific satiety to a liquid whole food in humans. This sensory-specific reduction in activation of the orbitofrontal cortex correlating with subjective pleasantness is consistent with an important role for the orbitofrontal cortex in human emotion and motivation, and associated subjective states.},

	abstract = {Many affective stimuli are hedonically complex mixtures containing both pleasant and unpleasant components. To investigate whether the brain represents the overall affective value of such complex stimuli, or the affective value of the different components simultaneously, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activations to a pleasant odor (jasmine), an unpleasant odor (indole), and a mixture of the two that was pleasant. In brain regions that represented the pleasantness of the odors such as the medial orbitofrontal cortex (as shown by activations that correlated with the pleasantness ratings), the mixture produced activations of similar magnitude to the pleasant jasmine, but very different from the unpleasant indole. These regions thus emphasize the pleasant aspects of the mixture. In contrast, in regions representing the unpleasantness of odors such as the dorsal anterior cingulate and midorbitofrontal cortex the mixture produced activations that were relatively further from the pleasant component jasmine and closer to the indole. These regions thus emphasize the unpleasant aspects of the mixture. Thus mixtures that are found pleasant can have components that are separately pleasant and unpleasant, and the brain can separately and simultaneously represent the positive and negative hedonic value of a complex affective stimulus that contains both pleasant and unpleasant olfactory components. This type of representation may be important for affective decision making in the brain in that separate representations of different affective components of the same sensory stimulus may provide the inputs for making a decision about whether to choose the stimulus or not.},

We found that the putamen responds to efficiency, whereas the insula encodes inequity, and the caudate/septal subgenual region encodes a unified measure of efficiency and inequity (utility). Notably, individual differences in inequity aversion correlate with activity in inequity and utility regions. Against utilitarianism, our results support the deontological intuition that a sense of fairness is fundamental to distributive justice but, as suggested by moral sentimentalists, is rooted in emotional processing. More generally, emotional responses related to norm violations may underlie individual differences in equity considerations and adherence to ethical rules.},

One possible motive for charitable contributions, called “pure altruism,” is satisfied by increases in the public good no matter the source or intent. Another possible motive, “warm glow,” is only fulfilled by an individual's own voluntary donations. Consistent with pure altruism, we find that even mandatory, tax-like transfers to a charity elicit neural activity in areas linked to reward processing. Moreover, neural responses to the charity's financial gains predict voluntary giving. However, consistent with warm glow, neural activity further increases when people make transfers voluntarily. Both pure altruism and warm-glow motives appear to determine the hedonic consequences of financial transfers to the public good.},

Examination of potential moderator variables indicated that studies lacking an objective standard of reality (d = −.15 versus −.03, for studies possessing such a standard) and that utilize self-report measures to measure symptoms of depression (d = .16 versus −.04, for studies which utilize structured interviews) were more likely to find depressive realism effects.

Further, unconscious processes can consider information that is difficult for conscious processes to access, such as rapidly presented information. The hypothesis that individuals can think about rapidly presented persuasive information and form attitudes based on that information to a greater extent when they think unconsciously versus consciously or when both conscious and unconscious thinking are limited was tested. All experimental participants listened to a quickly presented persuasive message containing either strong or weak arguments, and then reported their message attitudes (1) immediately, (2) after 3 min of conscious thought, or (3) after 3 min of distraction (unconscious thought). As predicted, only participants in the unconscious-thought conditions reported more favorable attitudes in response to strong versus weak arguments. These results support the existence of unconscious thought, and implications for this literature and persuasion models are discussed.},

Other lines of evidence suggest that this area of the brain represents quite basic information about the relative “economic” value of options, predicting a role for this region in value-based decision making even in the absence of uncertainty. We tested this prediction in human subjects with {VMF} damage. Preference judgment is a simple form of value-based decision making under certainty. We asked whether {VMF} damage in humans would lead to inconsistent preference judgments in a simple pairwise choice task. Twenty-one participants with focal damage to the frontal lobes were compared with 19 age- and education-matched control subjects. Subjects with {VMF} damage were significantly more inconsistent in their preferences than controls, whereas those with frontal damage that spared the {VMF} performed normally. These results argue that {VMF} plays a necessary role in certain as well as uncertain decision making in humans.},

In the context of the theory of planned behavior, the discriminant validity of constructs related to performing and not performing behaviors is tested. Moreover, the simultaneous validities of perceived behavioral control over doing and not doing for the prediction of both intentions and the incremental validity of both intentions in predicting behavior are investigated. Results show that the constructs related to performing and not performing a behavior independently contribute to the prediction of intentions and behaviors.

The first intuitive and empirical approaches to persuasion were guided by main-effect questions (e.g., are experts more persuasive than nonexperts?). Furthermore, researchers focused on only one process by which variables (e.g., emotion, source credibility) would have an impact (e.g., emotion affected attitudes by classical conditioning). As data began to accumulate, so many new theories and effects were uncovered that the discipline faced collapse from the numerous inconsistencies evident. In response to the reigning confusion of the previous era, contemporary multiprocess theories were proposed (e.g., the elaboration likelihood model). According to these more integrative approaches, any one variable could affect attitudes by different processes in different situations and thereby sometimes produce opposite effects. Finally, we describe the role of a recently discovered new contributor to persuasion: self-validation. Unlike previous mechanisms that focus on primary cognition, this new process emphasizes secondary or meta-cognition.},

Here we synthesize past observations to provide strong evidence that the default network is a specific, anatomically defined brain system preferentially active when individuals are not focused on the external environment. Analysis of connectional anatomy in the monkey supports the presence of an interconnected brain system. Providing insight into function, the default network is active when individuals are engaged in internally focused tasks including autobiographical memory retrieval, envisioning the future, and conceiving the perspectives of others. Probing the functional anatomy of the network in detail reveals that it is best understood as multiple interacting subsystems. The medial temporal lobe subsystem provides information from prior experiences in the form of memories and associations that are the building blocks of mental simulation. The medial prefrontal subsystem facilitates the flexible use of this information during the construction of self-relevant mental simulations. These two subsystems converge on important nodes of integration including the posterior cingulate cortex. The implications of these functional and anatomical observations are discussed in relation to possible adaptive roles of the default network for using past experiences to plan for the future, navigate social interactions, and maximize the utility of moments when we are not otherwise engaged by the external world. We conclude by discussing the relevance of the default network for understanding mental disorders including autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.},

On the basis of over 200 {fMRI} studies, it tests alternative theoretical proposals that attempt to explain how several brain areas process information relevant for social cognition. The results suggest that inferring temporary states such as goals, intentions, and desires of other people—even when they are false and unjust from our own perspective—strongly engages the temporo-parietal junction ({TPJ}). Inferring more enduring dispositions of others and the self, or interpersonal norms and scripts, engages the medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}), although temporal states can also activate the {mPFC}. Other candidate tasks reflecting general-purpose brain processes that may potentially subserve social cognition are briefly reviewed, such as sequence learning, causality detection, emotion processing, and executive functioning (action monitoring, attention, dual task monitoring, episodic memory retrieval), but none of them overlaps uniquely with the regions activated during social cognition. Hence, it appears that social cognition particularly engages the {TPJ} and {mPFC} regions. The available evidence is consistent with the role of a {TPJ}-related mirror system for inferring temporary goals and intentions at a relatively perceptual level of representation, and the {mPFC} as a module that integrates social information across time and allows reflection and representation of traits and norms, and presumably also of intentionality, at a more abstract cognitive level.

These two images of self are conceptualized as reflecting the emphasis on connectedness and relations often found in non-Western cultures (interdependent) and the separateness and uniqueness of the individual (independent) stressed in the West. It is argued that these two images of self can and do coexist in individuals and that they can be measured. A 24-item Self-Construal Scale measuring two dimensions of self-image is presented. The two distinct dimensions of the scale were supported in confirmatory factor analyses of two multiethnic samples of college students. The scale was found to have satisfactory reliability and validity. Its implications and potential applications are discussed.},

In this study, 23 adolescents were excluded during a ball-tossing game in which they believed they were playing with two other adolescents during an {fMRI} scan; in reality, participants played with a preset computer program. Afterwards, participants reported their exclusion-related distress and rejection sensitivity, and parents reported participants’ interpersonal competence. Similar to findings in adults, during social exclusion adolescents displayed insular activity that was positively related to self-reported distress, and right ventrolateral prefrontal activity that was negatively related to self-reported distress. Findings unique to adolescents indicated that activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex ({subACC}) related to greater distress, and that activity in the ventral striatum related to less distress and appeared to play a role in regulating activity in the {subACC} and other regions involved in emotional distress. Finally, adolescents with higher rejection sensitivity and interpersonal competence scores displayed greater neural evidence of emotional distress, and adolescents with higher interpersonal competence scores also displayed greater neural evidence of regulation, perhaps suggesting that adolescents who are vigilant regarding peer acceptance may be most sensitive to rejection experiences.},

Our findings were anatomically specific to amygdalar circuitry in that individual differences in social network size and complexity could not be explained by the strength of intrinsic connectivity between nodes within two networks that do not typically involve the amygdala (i.e., the mentalizing and mirror networks), and were behaviorally specific in that amygdala connectivity did not correlate with other self-report measures of sociality.},

Here, the authors focus on the role played by {fMRI} studies, where recent work has replicated the animal results in human subjects and has extended the view of putative reward-processing neural structures. In particular, {fMRI} work has identified a set of reward-related brain structures including the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, ventral striatum, and medial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, the human experiments have probed the dependence of human reward responses on learned expectations, context, timing, and the reward dimension. Current experiments aim to assess the function of human reward-processing structures to determine how they allow us to predict, assess, and act in response to rewards. The authors review current accomplishments in the study of human reward processing and focus their discussion on explanations directed particularly at the role played by the ventral striatum.

In addition, other structures, including the dorsal prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and lateral habenular nucleus, and specific brainstem structures such as the pedunculopontine nucleus, and the raphe nucleus, are key components in regulating the reward circuit.

The effect of social transmission on real-world voting was greater than the direct effect of the messages themselves, and nearly all the transmission occurred between /`close friends/' who were more likely to have a face-to-face relationship.

	abstract = {Introduction: The reasons that some smokers find it harder to quit than others are unclear. Understanding how individual differences predict smoking cessation outcomes may allow the development of more successful personalized treatments for nicotine dependence. Theoretical models suggest that drug users might be characterized by increased sensitivity to drug cues and by reduced sensitivity to nondrug-related natural rewards. We hypothesized that baseline differences in brain sensitivity to natural rewards and cigarette-related cues would predict the outcome of a smoking cessation attempt.
Methods: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we recorded prequit brain responses to neutral, emotional (pleasant and unpleasant), and cigarette-related cues from 55 smokers interested in quitting. We then assessed smoking abstinence, mood, and nicotine withdrawal symptoms during the course of a smoking cessation attempt.
Results: Using cluster analysis, we identified 2 groups of smokers who differed in their baseline responses to pleasant cues and cigarette-related cues in the posterior visual association areas, the dorsal striatum, and the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Smokers who showed lower prequit levels of brain reactivity to pleasant stimuli than to cigarette-related cues were less likely to be abstinent 6 months after their quit attempt, and they had higher levels of negative affect during the course of the quit attempt.
Conclusions: Smokers with blunted brain responses to pleasant stimuli, relative to cigarette-related stimuli, had more difficulty quitting smoking. For these individuals, the lack of alternative forms of reinforcement when nicotine deprived might be an important factor underlying relapse. Normalizing these pathological neuroadaptations may help them achieve abstinence.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the principal theoretical models of drug craving and provides some directions for future research. The main models are classified broadly into three categories: (1) phenomenological models; based on clinical observation and description; these have been influential in classification systems of addictive disorders and in the development of pharmacological therapies; (2) conditioning models: based on conditioning theory; these have been influential in the development of cue exposure treatments; (3) cognitive theories; based on cognitive social learning theory: these have been influential in the development of cognitive therapies of addiction. It is concluded that no one specific theory provides a complete explanation of the phenomenon of craving. However, theories of craving grounded in general theories of human behaviour offer greatest promise, and generate more specific and testable research hypotheses. Theories that do not require craving to be present for relapse to occur have more empirical support than those that provide simplistic causal explanations. The cue-reactivity model shows promise in the exploration of the relationship between craving and relapse. However, further attention to the phenomenology of craving could help to advise the future measurement and study of drug craving, particularly in the context of research in which drugs are available to human subjects, with adequate ethical safeguards. There is a need for further study of the temporal dynamics of craving and consensus in the field on the most appropriate methods of measurement. Finally, new psychotherapies such as cue exposure and pharmacotherapies that aim to attenuate drinking behaviour, such as naltrexone and acamprosate, provide opportunities to improve understanding of the nature and significance of craving. However, the relatively uncritical assumption that craving is the underlying basis of addiction and represents the most appropriate target for treatment is challenged.},

By means of activation likelihood estimation, we investigated the concurrence of brain regions activated by cue-induced craving paradigms across studies on nicotine, alcohol and cocaine addicts. Furthermore, we analysed the concurrence of brain regions positively correlated with self-reported craving in nicotine and alcohol studies. We found direct overlap between nicotine, alcohol and cocaine cue reactivity in the ventral striatum. In addition, regions of close proximity were observed in the anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}; nicotine and cocaine) and amygdala (alcohol, nicotine and cocaine). Brain regions of concurrence in drug cue-reactivity paradigms that overlapped with brain regions of concurrence in self-reported craving correlations were found in the {ACC}, ventral striatum and right pallidum (for alcohol). This first quantitative meta-analysis on drug cue reactivity identifies brain regions underlying nicotine, alcohol and cocaine dependency, i.e. the ventral striatum. The {ACC}, right pallidum and ventral striatum were related to drug cue reactivity as well as self-reported craving, suggesting that this set of brain regions constitutes the core circuit of drug craving in nicotine and alcohol addiction.},

In this article, we review the literature on the existence, causes, and treatment of cue-induced cravings: intense, episodic cravings typically provoked by situational cues associated with drug use. In laboratory research, smokers exposed to smoking-related cues demonstrate increased craving as well as distinct patterns of brain activation. Observational field studies indicate that such cue-induced cravings are substantially responsible for relapse to smoking but that smoking can often be averted by coping responses. The effects of pharmacological interventions are mixed. Steady-state medications (bupropion, varenicline, nicotine patch) do not appear to protect smokers from cue-induced cravings. However, acutely administered nicotine medications (such as nicotine gum and lozenge), used after cue exposure as “rescue medications,” can help a smoker's recovery from cue-induced cravings. Cue-induced craving plays an important role in smoking and relapse and likely in other addictions as well. Treatments to mitigate the effect of cue-induced craving are both important and needed.},

Here we discuss evidence that these transitions depend on interactions between pavlovian and instrumental learning processes. We hypothesize that the change from voluntary drug use to more habitual and compulsive drug use represents a transition at the neural level from prefrontal cortical to striatal control over drug seeking and drug taking behavior as well as a progression from ventral to more dorsal domains of the striatum, involving its dopaminergic innervation. These neural transitions may themselves depend on the neuroplasticity in both cortical and striatal structures that is induced by chronic self-administration of drugs.

The dysfunctions reflect (a) decreased sensitivity of reward circuits, (b) enhanced sensitivity of memory circuits to conditioned expectations to drugs and drug cues, stress reactivity, and (c) negative mood, and a weakened control circuit. Although initial experimentation with a drug of abuse is largely a voluntary behavior, continued drug use can eventually impair neuronal circuits in the brain that are involved in free will, turning drug use into an automatic compulsive behavior. The ability of addictive drugs to co-opt neurotransmitter signals between neurons (including dopamine, glutamate, and {GABA}) modifies the function of different neuronal circuits, which begin to falter at different stages of an addiction trajectory. Upon exposure to the drug, drug cues or stress this results in unrestrained hyperactivation of the motivation/drive circuit that results in the compulsive drug intake that characterizes addiction.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the application of the cue-reactivity paradigm as a means of studying alcohol dependence in clinical populations. Three main areas of application will be examined: cue-reactivity as a means of understanding the nature of alcohol dependence; cue-reactivity as a predictor of relapse; and cue-reactivity as a method of studying treatment effects. The study of cue exposure and cue-reactivity has a long history but it is only relatively recently that the potential of cue-reactivity as a means of understanding and treating addictive behaviours has been studied in depth. The principal advantage of cue-reactivity over other existing paradigms to study addictive behaviour is in having a solid basis in widely studied general theories of behaviour. Cue-reactivity also provides a means of measuring and unpacking the concept of craving. Craving has long been believed to represent the underlying basis for addictive behaviour, and in the majority of research studies craving has been conceptualized and measured in relatively simplistic ways. Craving has generally been viewed as a unitary phenomenon and measured using self-reported questionnaires. Such approaches have had limited explanatory value, particularly in recent psychopharmacology research. There is clearly a need to develop new paradigms to study the effects of pharmacological agents aimed at attenuating drinking behaviour. It is in this area that cue-reactivity currently offers the greatest potential. In particular, the cue-reactivity paradigm draws an important distinction between cue mediated craving and withdrawal craving. This can be viewed as similar to the distinction between generalised anxiety and anxiety provoked by phobic stimuli. However, while much is now known about the phenomenon of cue-reactivity, several aspects require further elucidation and research investment.},

	abstract = {Objective To assess the impact of the Western Australian tobacco point-of-sale display ban on spontaneous purchase behaviours.
Methods Daily adult smokers (n=402) observed purchasing cigarettes were recruited via exit interviews either 2 months before or after the implementation of the display ban. Smokers were asked if they had intended to purchase cigarettes before entering the store to assess spontaneous purchase behaviours. Whether smokers had noticed the displays before their purchase and the extent to which this influenced their purchase decision was also assessed via non-prompting questions.
Results When compared with before the ban, fewer smokers after the ban noticed the displays (27.1\% vs 1.1\%, p{\textless}0.001), fewer reported making spontaneous purchases (28.2\% vs 19.8\%, p{\textless}0.05) and fewer claimed the displays influenced their purchase decisions (free recall 5.0\% vs 1.1\%, p{\textless}0.05; cued recall 22.1\% vs 3.8\%, p{\textless}0.001). Before the ban, spontaneous purchasers were more likely than planned purchasers to suggest the displays influenced their purchase decisions (free recall 9.7\% vs 3.2\%, p{\textless}0.05; cued recall 40.0\% vs 17.9\%, p{\textless}0.01). After the ban, spontaneous purchasers nominating the influence of displays fell substantially (free recall 9.7\% vs 5.6\%, p={NS}; cued recall 40.0\% vs 11.1\%, p{\textless}0.01) as it did for planned purchasers (free recall 3.2\% vs 0.0\%, p{\textless}0.05; cued recall 17.9\% vs 2.1\%, p{\textless}0.01).
Conclusions We observed a 30\% reduction in smokers making spontaneous tobacco purchases after implementation of the Western Australian tobacco display ban and between a fivefold and sixfold reduction in the proportion suggesting displays influenced their decision to purchase cigarettes. These data are consistent with previous research suggesting tobacco displays encourage spontaneous purchases and their removal corresponds to reductions in the same.},

In the larger study, all smokers used nicotine and placebo patch (double blind) for 1 week each following a preceding week of ad lib smoking, in a 2 × 2 cross-over design. Generalized estimating equation ({GEE}) models determined the predictive ability of cue-induced craving (cue reactivity) on subsequent success at initiating a quit attempt (at least 24 hr quit) for each patch condition. Smokers who exhibited greater craving during exposure to smoking cues had significantly greater odds of successfully initiating abstinence during either quit attempt week (i.e., the nicotine or placebo patch week). This relationship was not statistically significant for self-reported craving in response to neutral cues. However, a greater smoking-neutral cue difference score for cue-induced craving was also a significant predictor of successfully initiating abstinence, but only among those not monetarily reinforced.

	abstract = {Introduction: Craving is often portrayed as a defining feature of addiction, but the role of craving in the addictive process is controversial. Particularly contentious is the extent to which drug craving predicts subsequent relapse.
Methods: This review synthesizes findings from 62 smoking cessation studies published through December 2011. Eligible studies measured craving for cigarettes in treatment-seeking smokers and related this to subsequent smoking status. The relationships of general craving and cue-specific craving with treatment outcome were examined separately. Further, analyses that related general craving to smoking status were divided into those that used craving data collected before the quit attempt, after the quit attempt, and those that used change in craving over time as a predictor.
Results: Results across studies revealed a total of 198 indices of association with 94 (47\%) of these being significant. In general, the findings indicated (a) there were only a few cases of significant associations between craving collected as part of cue-reactivity studies and treatment outcome, (b) postquit craving was a stronger predictor of treatment outcome than prequit craving, and (c) several moderators likely influence the relationship between craving and cessation outcome.
Conclusions: The overall results suggest that craving is not a necessary condition of relapse. In addition, inconsistent relationships between craving and treatment outcome call into question the value of craving as a target of treatment and underscore limitations in the prognostic utility of craving.},

The efficacy of {CET} is predicated on successful extinction, yet the process of extinction in {CET} trials has rarely been demonstrated. This study explored the extinction process using a cue-reactivity paradigm in smokers undergoing multiple {CET} sessions as part of a comprehensive smoking cessation treatment.
Methods: The sample comprised 76 moderately dependent, treatment-seeking smokers who completed at least 4 {CET} sessions and 6 counseling sessions. The {CET} and counseling sessions were scheduled twice weekly, and participants began using transdermal nicotine replacement therapy on their quit day, which occurred prior to initiation of {CET}. Each {CET} session consisted of presentation of 140 images on a computer screen, with self-reported craving as the primary measure of cue reactivity.
Results: Mixed-model analyses revealed a progressive decline in cue-provoked craving both within and across 6 sessions of {CET}. Moderator analyses showed that the decline in craving was greatest among those who displayed initial cue reactivity.
Conclusions: These data are consistent with the premise that {CET} can produce extinction of laboratory-based cue-provoked smoking cravings and highlight important individual differences that may influence extinction. Implications for conducting cue exposure research and interventions are discussed.},

	abstract = {Smoking-related cues elicit craving and mesocorticolimbic brain activation in smokers. Severity of nicotine dependence seems to moderate cue reactivity, but the direction and mechanisms of its influence remains unclear. Although tobacco control policies demand a ban on tobacco advertising, cue reactivity studies in smokers so far have not employed tobacco advertisement as experimental stimuli. We investigated whether tobacco advertisement elicits cue reactivity at a behavioral (subjective craving) and a neural level (using functional magnetic resonance imaging) in 22 smokers and 21 never-smokers. Moreover, we studied the influence of severity of dependence on cue reactivity. In smokers, tobacco advertisement elicited substantially more craving than control advertisement whereas never-smokers reported no cue induced craving. Surprisingly, neuronal cue reactivity did not differ between smokers and never-smokers. Moderately dependent smokers' craving increased over the course of the experiment, whereas highly dependent smokers' craving was unaffected. Moderately dependent smokers' brain activity elicited by tobacco advertisement was higher in the amygdala, hippocampus, putamen and thalamus compared with highly dependent smokers. Furthermore, limbic brain activation predicted picture recognition rates after the scanning session, even in never-smokers. Our findings show that tobacco advertisement elicits cigarette craving and neuronal cue reactivity primarily in moderately dependent smokers, indicating that they might be particularly responsive towards external smoking-related cues. On the other hand, neuronal cue reactivity and cigarette craving in highly dependent smokers is more likely triggered by internal cues such as withdrawal symptoms. Tobacco advertisement seems to likewise appeal to smokers and non-smokers, clarifying the potential danger especially for young non-smokers.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Acutely increased urge to smoke, or craving, in response to smoking cues (i.e., “cue reactivity”) is often believed to identify those less able to later quit smoking. Although absolute craving level can predict smoking behavior, smoking cue reactivity per se may not predict cessation outcome.
Methods: All clinical trials of cue reactivity and cessation outcome published before 2007 were identified and supplemented with a web-based search of clinical studies published after 2006, producing one additional trial. Examined were a total of 6 studies that directly related self-reported craving in response to laboratory-presented smoking cues with subsequent ability to quit smoking.
Results: Of the 6 studies, only one found that lower cue reactivity predicted greater quitting success (with nicotine but not placebo patch). Another study found the opposite, that higher cue reactivity was related to greater, rather than less, quitting success (in an unaided attempt). The other studies showed no association between cue reactivity and cessation outcome.
Conclusions: This limited research does not clearly support self-reported craving in response to smoking cues per se as a predictor of later quitting success. Lack of consistent results may partly be due to variability in methods of smoking cue assessment, type of cessation treatment, and duration of follow-up assessment. If it is to improve our understanding of an individual’s ability to quit smoking, research on cue reactivity needs to show significant and reliable associations with subsequent long-term smoking behavior.},

Methods: Participants (ages 13–19, 74 daily smokers, and 22 nonsmokers) completed baseline questionnaires and laboratory assessments (Session 1) and returned 1–4 days later to repeat the laboratory assessments (Session 2); half of the smokers were randomly assigned to overnight tobacco abstinence preceding Session 2.
Results: During Session 2, abstinent smokers reported significantly greater increases in withdrawal symptoms, smoking urges, and negative affect compared with smokers who did not abstain and compared with nonsmokers. Although there was not a significant effect of abstinence on differential reactivity to smoking versus neutral cues, abstinence did result in significantly increased peak provoked urges and negative effect. There was not a significant effect of abstinence on positive affect or reactive irritability,
Conclusions: Our results suggest that adolescents experience increases in withdrawal symptoms, smoking urges (un-cued and peak provoked), and negative affect (un-cued and peak provoked) after acute smoking abstinence, but do not experience the increases in reactive irritability or decreases in positive affect that have been shown in adult smokers. Overall findings support the withdrawal relief and negative reinforcement models of smoking maintenance in adolescents and point to withdrawal, urge, and negative affect as important targets for treatment.},

	abstract = {Smoking cue-exposure research has provided a powerful tool for examining cravings in the laboratory. A key attraction of this method is that tightly controlled experimental procedures can model craving experiences that are presumed to relate to addiction. Despite its appeal, key assumptions underlying the clinical relevance of smoking cue-reactivity studies have been questioned recently. For both conceptual and methodological reasons it may be difficult to tease apart cue-based and abstinence-based cravings. Moreover, conventional cue-reactivity procedures typically generate levels of craving with only minimal clinical relevance. We argue here that sometimes it is unfeasible—and in some instances conceptually misguided—to disentangle abstinence-based and cued components of cigarette cravings. In light of the challenges associated with cue-reactivity research, we offer an alternative approach to smoking cue-exposure experimental research focusing on peak provoked craving ({PPC}) states. The {PPC} approach uses nicotine-deprived smokers and focuses on urges during smoking cue-exposure without subtracting out urge ratings during control cue or baseline assessments. This design relies on two factors found in many cue-exposure studies—nicotine deprivation and exposure to explicit smoking cues—which, when combined, can create powerful craving states. The {PPC} approach retains key aspects of the cue-exposure method, and in many circumstances may be a viable design for studies examining robust laboratory-induced cravings.},

The present review sought to determine the magnitude and overall pattern of responses typically found in cue-reactivity research and which, if any, learning-based model of cue reactivity is best supported by the findings. Design. Meta-analytical techniques were used to select and evaluate results from 41 cue-reactivity studies that compared responses of alcoholics, cigarette smokers, cocaine addicts or heroin addicts to drug-related versus neutral stimuli. Effect sizes were calculated, separately by addict type, for self-report of craving and physiological responses (heart rate, sweat gland activity and skin temperature). Findings. Across all addict groups, the effect size for craving was +0.92. Alcoholics had a significantly smaller craving effect size (+0.53) compared to other addict groups (+1.18 to +1.29). Relatively smaller effect sizes were found for physiological responses. The general profile of effect sizes across all addict groups was increased heart rate (+0.26) and sweat gland activity (+0.40) and decreased skin temperature (-0.24) when addicts were presented with drug-related stimuli. Conclusions. The cuereactivity paradigm can produce a stable profile of significant effects and, therefore, has a number of potential applications for investigating addictive phenomena.

Results: In total, 206 daily smokers aged 18–76 years (90 male, 116 female) were interviewed. Unplanned cigarette purchases were made by 22\% of participants. {POS} displays influenced nearly four times as many unplanned purchases as planned purchases (47\% vs 12\%, p{\textless}0.01).

Results: Most smokers (60\%) made multiple transitions among smoking, reduction, and abstinence.

Most quit attempts (79\%) lasted less than 1 day; about one fifth (18\%) of the participants were abstinent at 12 weeks.

Background

A number of treatments can help smokers make a successful quit attempt, but many initially successful quitters relapse over time. Several interventions have been proposed to help prevent relapse.

Objectives
Objectives

To assess whether specific interventions for relapse prevention reduce the proportion of recent quitters who return to smoking.

Search methods
Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in May 2013 for studies mentioning relapse prevention or maintenance in title, abstracts or keywords.

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of relapse prevention interventions with a minimum follow-up of six months. We included smokers who quit on their own, were undergoing enforced abstinence, or were participating in treatment programmes. We included trials that compared relapse prevention interventions with a no intervention control, or that compared a cessation programme with additional relapse prevention components with a cessation programme alone.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

Studies were screened and data extracted by one review author, and checked by a second. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by referral to a third review author.

Main results
Main results

Sixty-three studies met inclusion criteria but were heterogeneous in terms of populations and interventions. We considered 41 studies that randomly assigned abstainers separately from studies that randomly assigned participants before their quit date.
Upon looking at studies of behavioural interventions that randomly assigned abstainers, we detected no benefit of brief and 'skills-based' relapse prevention methods for women who had quit smoking because of pregnancy, or for smokers undergoing a period of enforced abstinence during hospitalisation or military training. We also failed to detect significant effects of behavioural interventions in trials in unselected groups of smokers who had quit on their own or through a formal programme. Amongst trials randomly assigning smokers before their quit date and evaluating the effects of additional relapse prevention components, we found no evidence of benefit of behavioural interventions or combined behavioural and pharmacotherapeutic interventions in any subgroup. Overall, providing training in skills thought to be needed for relapse avoidance did not reduce relapse, but most studies did not use experimental designs best suited to the task and had limited power to detect expected small differences between interventions. For pharmacological interventions, extended treatment with varenicline significantly reduced relapse in one trial (risk ratio ({RR}) 1.18, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.03 to 1.36). Pooling of six studies of extended treatment with bupropion failed to detect a significant effect ({RR} 1.15, 95\% {CI} 0.98 to 1.35). Two small trials of oral nicotine replacement treatment ({NRT}) failed to detect an effect, but treatment compliance was low, and in two other trials of oral {NRT} in which short-term abstainers were randomly assigned, a significant effect of intervention was noted.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

At the moment, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific behavioural intervention to help smokers who have successfully quit for a short time to avoid relapse. The verdict is strongest for interventions focused on identifying and resolving tempting situations, as most studies were concerned with these. Little research is available regarding other behavioural approaches.
Extended treatment with varenicline may prevent relapse. Extended treatment with bupropion is unlikely to have a clinically important effect. Studies of extended treatment with nicotine replacement are needed.},

	abstract = {Aim:  The aim of this study was to characterise the natural course of smoking cessation behaviour in a web-based survey of current and former cigarette smokers ({CS} and {FS}) in the United States. Methods:  A web-based survey of {CS} and {FS} was conducted in April 2009; demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and smoking history (including the number of lifetime and length of latest quit attempts, aids used and time to relapse) were collated. The surveyed cohort was selected from prescreened {CS} and {FS} panellists and matched for age, race and education, to be representative of the {US} population. Descriptive statistics and time-to-event analyses using Kaplan–Meier curves were applied in the analysis of this report. Results:  The final cohort comprised 512 {CS} and 566 {FS} (n = 1078). A larger proportion of {FS} than {CS} reported a longest smoke-free period of {\textgreater} 1 year (78.8\% vs. 22.4\%, respectively). As a greater variety of smoking cessation products became available over time, the proportion of unassisted quit attempts decreased from 76.1\% prior to 1983 to 43.9\% after 2006 for {CS} and from 79.3\% to 50.3\% for {FS}. The cumulative proportion of subjects relapsing was 31.3\% by 1 week and 79.3\% by 6 months. The estimated median time to next quit attempt was approximately 360 days. Conclusions:  These data confirm that relapse is common and that as the variety of cessation modalities increase, the proportion of unassisted quit attempts decreases. Self-help or cold-turkey methods still provide significant alternatives even when pharmacotherapy is available. This study provides data related to the smoking history and smoking cessation patterns of a large, nationally representative sample of {CS} and {FS}.},

	abstract = {It is commonly believed that information spreads between individuals like a pathogen, with each exposure by an informed friend potentially resulting in a naive individual becoming infected. However, empirical studies of social media suggest that individual response to repeated exposure to information is far more complex. As a proxy for intervention experiments, we compare user responses to multiple exposures on two different social media sites, Twitter and Digg. We show that the position of exposing messages on the user-interface strongly affects social contagion. Accounting for this visibility significantly simplifies the dynamics of social contagion. The likelihood an individual will spread information increases monotonically with exposure, while explicit feedback about how many friends have previously spread it increases the likelihood of a response. We provide a framework for unifying information visibility, divided attention, and explicit social feedback to predict the temporal dynamics of user behavior.},

Design: Comparison of measures of daily cigarette consumption from several sources, from 232 smokers entering a smoking cessation program. Main Outcome Measures: Global reports of average smoking, Time-Line Follow-Back ({TLFB}) recall for the week preceding the study (premonitoring {TLFB}), 2 weeks' cigarette recordings using electronic diaries and ecological momentary assessment ({EMA}), and {TLFB} recall of smoking during {EMA} (monitored {TLFB}). Results: Global reports and premonitoring {TLFB} showed severe digit bias: six times as many values as expected were rounded at 10. Monitored {TLFB} also showed substantial digit bias (four times). {EMA} data showed none. {EMA} averaged 2.6 cigarettes lower than monitored {TLFB}, but exceeded {TLFB} on 32\% of days. Across days, {EMA} and {TLFB} only correlated 0.29. Daily variations in {TLFB} did not correlate with variations in carbon monoxide ({CO}) measures taken on 3 days, but {EMA} measures did; among participants whose {CO} varied, r = .69. {CO} correlated with {EMA} cigarettes recorded in the preceding 2 hours, suggesting timely recording of cigarettes. Conclusion: {TLFB} measures are limited for precise assessment of cigarette consumption. {EMA} measures appear to be useful for tracking smoking, and likely other health-relevant events.},

	abstract = {Drug cues have been shown to activate brain regions involved in attention, motivation, and reward in addicted users. However, as studies have typically measured responses in only one state (ie drug abstinence), it is unclear whether observed activations represent amplification by abstinence or stable responses. Thus, the present study was designed to evaluate the stability of event-related responses to visual drug cues in dependent smokers (n=13) using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging measures. Imaging was conducted following smoking as usual and following overnight abstinence, and self-reported craving measures were obtained before, during, and after scanning. Analysis of hemodynamic response ({HDR}) amplitudes in each of 13 regions of interest revealed larger responses to smoking compared to control cues in ventral anterior cingulate gyrus ({vACG}) and superior frontal gyrus. Responses to smoking cues in these and all other regions revealed no effects of abstinence/satiety, thus supporting the notion that cue-elicited brain responses are relatively stable. However, while the abstinence manipulation did not alter group-level responses to smoking cues, at the individual level, abstinence-induced changes in craving (abstinence minus satiety) were positively correlated with changes in {HDR} amplitude to smoking cues in frontal regions including left inferior frontal gyrus, left {vACG}, and bilateral middle frontal gyrus. These results suggest that brain responses to smoking cues, while relatively stable at the group level following short-term abstinence, may be modulated by individual differences in craving in response to abstinence—particularly in regions subserving attention and motivation.},

Behavioral studies suggest that drug availability and withdrawal can affect the individual response to drug cues. Moreover, the importance of subjective craving in cue-induced relapse has been questioned and an alternative model put forward according to which drug cues trigger habitual drug-seeking behaviors independently of craving. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare the brain response to smoking and control videotapes in 20 healthy smokers, while varying their expectancy to smoke and abstinence levels. The neural response to cigarette cues was strongly modulated by expectancy and, to a lesser extent, abstinence. In people expecting to smoke immediately after the scan, smoking cues activated brain areas implicated in arousal, attention, and cognitive control. However, when subjects knew they would not be allowed to smoke for 4 h, there was almost no brain activation in response to smoking cues, despite equivalent reported levels of craving. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the neural response was a function of both craving and expectancy. Thalamo-cingulate connectivity, thought to be an index of arousal, was greater during expectancy than nonexpectancy. Our findings confirm the importance of expectancy in the neural response to drug cues, and lend support to the theory that these cues act on brain areas involved in arousal and attention.},

(2) Once the first cigarette is initiated, does stress facilitate subsequent smoking? Using a within-subject design, daily smokers (n = 37) who were nicotine deprived overnight received a personalized imagery induction (stress or neutral) on two separate days, and then had the option of initiating a tobacco self-administration session or delaying initiation for up to 50 min in exchange for three levels of monetary reinforcement. Subsequently, the tobacco self-administration session entailed a 1-hour period in which subjects could choose to smoke using a smoking topography system. Following the stress induction, subjects were less able to resist smoking, smoked more intensely (increased puffs, shorter inter-puff interval, and greater peak puff velocity), and perceived greater satisfaction and reward from smoking. Stress significantly increased hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal ({HPA}) axis reactivity, tobacco craving, negative emotion, and physiologic reactivity relative to the neutral condition. In addition, increased cortisol, {ACTH}, and tobacco craving were associated with reduced ability to resist smoking following stress. These findings have implications for understanding the impact of stress on smoking relapse and model development to assess smoking lapse behavior.},

	abstract = {Introduction: We explored the relationship between the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence ({FTND}) and smoking abstinence rates in 10 randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2–4 varenicline studies.
Methods: Participants were adult smokers (≥10 cigarettes/day) who were motivated to quit. Efficacy end points included continuous abstinence rate ({CAR}) for weeks 9–24 analyzed, by baseline {FTND} and Heaviness of Smoking Index ({HSI}) scores, and treatment. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models.
Results: Overall, 2,763 varenicline (M [{SD}] {FTND} score: 5.6 [2.2]) and 2,229 placebo subjects (5.5 [2.1]) were included in the analysis. An increase of one unit in baseline {FTND} or {HSI} score decreased the odds of abstinence at Week 24 by 11\% (odds ratio [{OR}] 0.89, 95\% {CI} 0.86–0.92, p {\textless} .0001) and 18\% ({OR} 0.82, 95\% {CI} 0.79–0.87, p {\textless} .0001), respectively. Treatment had a significant impact on {CAR} 9–24: odds of abstinence were increased threefold for varenicline versus placebo ({OR} 3.3, 95\% {CI} 2.8–3.8, p {\textless} .0001). There was no interaction between treatment and {FTND} (p = .98) or {HSI} score (p = .97) for {CAR} 9–24. The {HSI} score predicted abstinence outcome as effectively as the {FTND} score.
Conclusion: Abstinence rates decreased with increasing dependence scores. There was no interaction between treatment and baseline {FTND} or {HSI} score, suggesting that they have no effect on the efficacy of varenicline versus placebo. These results also suggest that the {HSI} may be as effective at predicting smoking cessation outcome as the whole {FTND} questionnaire.},

Although tobacco smoke contains many substances, researchers and policymakers agree that nicotine is a major cause of tobacco dependence. Understanding the neural substrates of nicotine dependence is essential for the development of more effective antismoking medications than those currently available. This article focuses on the neural substrates, especially nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, that mediate the reinforcing effects of nicotine and the development of nicotine dependence. Neuroadaptations in the function of the neurotransmitters dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABA}), which have been shown to be critically involved in nicotine dependence, are also reviewed.

A 2009 review found evidence of a positive association between exposure to point-of-sale ({POS}) tobacco promotion and increased smoking and smoking susceptibility, though limitations in the evidence base were identified.
Aim and Methods: We reviewed and critically appraised recent evidence documenting the influence of {POS} tobacco promotion, and {POS} tobacco display bans, on smoking-related behavior and cognitions. We reviewed original quantitative and qualitative research that examined the relationship between {POS} tobacco promotion and smoking prevalence, individual-level smoking, and quitting and tobacco purchasing behavior, smoking susceptibility, and smoking-related cognitions.
Results: Twenty peer-reviewed studies (18 quantitative and 2 qualitative) met the inclusion criteria; each study reported findings consistent with a positive association between exposure to {POS} tobacco promotion and smoking or smoking susceptibility. Several studies met key criteria for causality: 4 indicated a dose–response association, 2 prospective studies were identified, and evidence from intervention studies supported the reversibility of the association. Findings were consistent across different study designs, settings, and measures.
Conclusions: The existing evidence supports a positive association between exposure to {POS} tobacco promotion and smoking. This review provides evidence to support the continuation of {POS} tobacco display bans in those jurisdictions where such legislation has been introduced and strengthens the evidence encouraging similar policies in jurisdictions without a {POS} display ban.},

We used parametric recurrent event survival analyses to better understand the dynamic relationship between a set of Abstinence Violation Effect ({AVE}, Marlatt \& Gordon, 1985) responses to lapsing and subsequent lapse-relapse progression. Participants were 203 smokers who achieved abstinence and responded to items assessing three core components of the {AVE} (internal attribution, abstinence self-efficacy and guilt) following a total of 1,001 lapse episodes in near real time. Neither self-blame, self-efficacy, nor guilt following participants' first lapse predicted relapse. Controlling for responses to their first lapse, responses to each additional lapse did prospectively predict lapse progression, such that drops in self-efficacy were associated with accelerated progression to a subsequent lapse ({HR} = 1.09, {CI} = 1.02–1.15), while increases in internal attributions of blame actually protected against lapsing ({HR} = 0.98, {CI} = 0.97–0.99). Treatment with nicotine patches slowed recurrent lapse progression ({HR} = 0.58, {CI} = 0.48–0.70), but this effect dissipated over multiple lapses, and was moderated by elevated ratings of postlapse guilt ({HR} = 1.08, {CI} = 1.01–1.18), which predicted accelerated progression within the active patch group, while protecting against lapse in the placebo group. Results highlight the dynamic nature of lapse responses during smoking cessation, indicating that self-efficacy predicts progression from one lapse to the next, while attributions of self-blame and guilt influenced progression in unexpected ways.},

	abstract = {Health-related behaviors occur as part of a broad socio-ecological context that unfolds dynamically over time. Yet systematic quantification of the way individuals come into contact with health-related features in their local environment remains a difficult challenge. Doing so requires a multi-tiered approach that integrates both individual geo-location data and comprehensive community-level information about health-related features in the local built environment. This report describes the implementation of a system for quantification of real-time exposure to point-of-sale tobacco marketing via mobile phone geo-location tracking. Individual mobility patterns from a longitudinal cohort of {DC} residents (N=486) were overlaid on an existing community-level point-of-sale surveillance geodatabase (N=1, 080 stores). Participants were {DC} residents who carried a geo-location tracking device over the first 8-weeks of a smoking cessation attempt. Tracking data were then used to produce a mobility "signature," physically linking each person to their surrounding point-of-sale marketing environment in real-time. Results demonstrate the dynamic nature of an individuals' experience of the point-of-sale environment. We identify substantial between-person differences in tobacco product pricing exposure, and find that these correspond to clusters of individuals whose price exposures vary systematically over time of day. These data suggest that perceptions of the point-of-sale environment as relatively static fail to account for the mobility and preferences of individuals as they actively engage with their neighborhoods over time.},

	abstract = {Background
Little is known about the factors that drive the association between point-of-sale marketing and behavior, because methods that directly link individual-level use outcomes to real-world point-of-sale exposure are only now beginning to be developed.
Purpose
Daily outcomes during smoking cessation were examined as a function of both real-time geospatial exposure to point-of-sale tobacco ({POST}) and subjective craving to smoke.
Methods
Continuous individual geospatial location data collected over the first month of a smoking-cessation attempt in 2010–2012 (N=475) were overlaid on a {POST} outlet geodatabase (N=1060). Participants’ mobility data were used to quantify the number of times they came into contact with a {POST} outlet. Participants recorded real-time craving levels and smoking status via ecological momentary assessment ({EMA}) on cellular telephones.
Results
The final data set spanned a total of 12,871 days of {EMA} and geospatial tracking. Lapsing was significantly more likely on days with any {POST} contact ({OR}=1.19, 95\% {CI}=1.18, 1.20), and increasingly likely as the number of daily {POST} contacts increased ({OR}=1.07, 95\% {CI}=1.06, 1.08). Overall, daily {POST} exposure was significantly associated with lapsing when craving was low ({OR}=1.22, 95\% {CI}=1.20, 1.23); high levels of craving were more directly associated with lapse outcomes.
Conclusions
These data shed light on the way mobility patterns drive a dynamic interaction between individuals and the {POST} environment, demonstrating that quantification of individuals’ exposure to {POST} marketing can be used to identify previously unrecognized patterns of association among individual mobility, the built environment, and behavioral outcomes.},

Yet little is known about the way smoking-related expectancies vary across different contexts. Two internal contexts that are often linked with smoking relapse are states associated with smoking abstinence and alcohol consumption. This report presents a secondary analysis of data from two experiments designed to examine the influence of smoking abstinence, and smoking abstinence combined with alcohol consumption, on smoking-related outcome expectancies among heavy smokers and tobacco chippers (smokers who had consistently smoked no more than 5 cigarettes/day for at least 2 years). Across both experiments, smoking abstinence and alcohol consumption increased expectancies of positive reinforcement from smoking. In addition, alcohol consumption increased negative reinforcement expectancies among tobacco chippers, such that the expectancies became more similar to those of heavy smokers as tobacco chippers' level of subjective alcohol intoxication increased. Findings suggest that these altered states influence the way smokers evaluate the consequences of smoking, and provide insight into the link between smoking abstinence, alcohol consumption, and smoking behavior.},

To identify predictors of attempts to stop smoking and predictors of relapse.
Methods
This study included 2431 smokers from pre-existing Internet panels in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Spain. These panel members are Internet users who have registered voluntarily and agreed to participate in various online research studies. Respondents were aged 35–65 years, smoked ≥ five cigarettes per day and intended to stop smoking in the next 3 months. They were followed every 3 months for up to 18 months via Internet contact on measures relating to quit attempts, smoking status, motivation to quit, nicotine cue, weight and weight concern, health-related factors, withdrawal symptoms, and smoking cessation aids.
Results
In this study, recent quit attempts strongly predicted future attempts, but also predicted subsequent relapse. Motivation to quit was predictive of future attempts but not of relapse/abstinence following the attempts. Relapse to smoking was associated with nicotine dependence, exposure to smoking cues, craving, withdrawal symptoms, and lack of smoking cessation aids.
Conclusions
The findings lend support to a model of cessation in which level of motivation to stop generates quit attempts but plays little role in relapse. Dependence, social smoking cues, and a recently failed quit attempt are important factors in relapse.},

	abstract = {The decline in cigarette smoking in high-income countries is attributed to the increasing social unacceptability of smoking, a cultural shift in which tobacco control policies are identified as playing a major part. While seen as essential to protect public health, there is a growing appreciation that these polices may have contributed to a social climate in which smoking is stigmatised. The paper reviews this debate on smoking and stigma. It notes that individuals are represented by their smoking status; other social differences are typically treated as secondary. Thus, while the links between disadvantage and smoking are acknowledged, social class remains on the margins of the debate. The paper argues instead that class provides an essential analytic lens through which to understand the stigma of smoking and the stigmatising impacts of tobacco control policies. In support of its argument, it discusses how the stigmatisation of smoking has occurred against a backdrop of widening socioeconomic differentials in smoking and the increasing importance of the body and behaviour in public discourses about social class and moral worth. The paper concludes by underlining the importance of embedding tobacco control research and policy in an appreciation of social class, and social inequalities more broadly.},

	abstract = {Background Although social smoking has increased among young adults, it remains a poorly understood behaviour. The authors explored how young adult social smokers viewed and defined smoking and the strategies they used to reconcile their conflicting smoker and non-smoker identities. The authors also examined alcohol's role in facilitating social smoking and investigated measures that would decouple drinking and smoking.
Methods The authors conducted 13 in-depth interviews with young adult social smokers aged between 19 and 25 years and used thematic analysis to interpret the transcripts.
Results The authors identified four key themes: the demarcation strategies social smokers used to avoid classifying themselves as smokers, social smoking as a tactic that ameliorates the risk of alienation, alcohol as a catalyst of social smoking and the difficulty participants experienced in reconciling their identity as non-smokers who smoke.
Conclusions Although social smokers regret smoking, their retrospective remorse was insufficient to promote behaviour change, and environmental modifications appear more likely to promote smoke-free behaviours among social smokers. Participants strongly supported extending the smoke-free areas outside bars, a measure that would help decouple their alcohol-fuelled behaviours from the identity to which they aspire.},

Understanding and developing interventions within such a complex system requires new analytic approaches. We draw on recent advances in dynamic network modeling to develop a technique that explores the implications of various intervention strategies targeted toward micro-level processes. Our approach begins by estimating a stochastic actor-based model using data from one school in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The model provides estimates of several factors predicting friendship ties and smoking behavior. We then use estimated model parameters to simulate the coevolution of friendship and smoking behavior under potential intervention scenarios. Namely, we manipulate the strength of peer influence on smoking and the popularity of smokers relative to nonsmokers. We measure how these manipulations affect smoking prevalence, smoking initiation, and smoking cessation. Results indicate that both peer influence and smoking-based popularity affect smoking behavior and that their joint effects are nonlinear. This study demonstrates how a simulation-based approach can be used to explore alternative scenarios that may be achievable through intervention efforts and offers new hypotheses about the association between friendship and smoking.},

	abstract = {Background
Peers influence adolescent and young adult smoking, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. It is necessary to understand whether the current assumption of peer pressure is valid, or whether an alternative explanation as imitation is more appropriate. We examined whether passive (imitation) and/or active (pressure) peer influence affects young adult smoking.
Methods
An experiment was conducted among 68 daily-smoking students aged 16–24. The actual study aim was masked. Participants had to do a 30-min music task with a confederate. The experiment consisted of a 2 (smoking condition: confederate smokes or not) by 2 (pressure condition: confederate offers the participant a cigarette or not) factorial design, resulting in four conditions: (1) no smoking and no pressure (N = 15); (2) smoking but no pressure (N = 16); (3) pressure but no smoking (N = 20); and (4) smoking and pressure (N = 17). The primary outcome tested was the total number of cigarettes smoked during this music assignment.
Results
Peer smoking significantly predicted the total number of cigarettes smoked by young adults while peer pressure did not. The interaction effect of peer pressure and peer smoking was not significant.
Conclusions
Peer pressure did not have a significant additional contribution, over and above smoking of the peer. Passive (imitation) peer influence affected young adult smoking rather than active (pressure) peer influence. Thus, smoking cessation efforts should aim at preventing interaction with smoking peers and raising awareness about its impact.},

Results: The studies identify the incidence of phantom smokers (29.6\% in Michigan and 5.5\% in Florida). Different questions resulted in different smoking rates. Phantom smokers expect more negative affect reduction and social facilitation from smoking than nonsmokers. Phantom smokers display ambivalent attitudes toward a typical smoker's image.

As predictors, psychological factors (i.e., parentnoncompliance, friendcompliance, rebelliousness, achievement motivation, and thrill seeking) and social environmental factors (i.e., parent's and friend's smoking) were measured when adolescents were 17–18 years old. Main Outcome Measures: As main outcome measures, smoking acquisition and cessation were assessed both at ages 18 and 28. Results: Psychological and social factors predicted 3\% to 7\% probability (p {\textless} .05) of smoking acquisition and a nonsignificant to 24\% probability (p {\textless} .05) of smoking continuation (not quitting) in young adulthood. Both friendcompliance and rebelliousness were more powerful predictors of young adult-smoking continuation than of smoking acquisition. Conclusion: First evidence that parent noncompliance, friend compliance, and a lack of achievement motivation predict smoking acquisition and (with the exception of parent noncompliance) smoking continuation in young adulthood. Including these psychological factors in future interventions designed to promote young adult smoking cessation may be useful.},

Design  Principal component analysis and other psychometric analyses of self-report data. Setting  San Francisco, California. Participants  A total of 507 adult smokers of at least 10 cigarettes per day diverse in gender, sexual orientation and ethnoracial status. Measurements  The primary measure was a draft version of the {SAQ}. Additional measures assessed a variety of other smoking-related constructs. Findings  Analyses yielded 10 scales of the {SAQ}: Withdrawal, Social Improvement/Non-smoker Identity, Adverse Outcomes, Treatment Effectiveness, Common Reasons, Barriers to Treatment, Social Support, Optimistic Outcomes, Coffee Use and Weight Gain. The {SAQ} scales demonstrated internal consistencies ranging from 0.62 to 0.85 and were associated with tobacco dependence, motivation to quit, abstinence self-efficacy, withdrawal symptoms, dietary restraint, shape and weight concern and tobacco use expectancies. The {SAQ} predicted smoking-related constructs above and beyond tobacco use expectancies, suggesting that abstinence-related expectancies and tobacco use expectancies are distinct from one another. Conclusions  A newly developed questionnaire, the Smoking Abstinence Questionnaire, appears to capture reliably smokers' expectancies for abstinence (Withdrawal, Social Improvement/Non-smoker Identity, Adverse Outcomes, Common Reasons, Optimistic Outcomes, Coffee Use, and Weight Gain) and expectancies related to the success of a quit attempt (Treatment Effectiveness, Barriers to Treatment and Social Support). It remains to be seen how far any of these expectancies predict attempts to quit, withdrawal, treatment utilization and response and quitting success above and beyond existing measures.},

The first study surveyed 810 Californians about energy conservation and found that descriptive normative beliefs were more predictive of behavior than were other relevant beliefs, even though respondents rated such norms as least important in their conservation decisions. Study 2, a field experiment, showed that normative social influence produced the greatest change in behavior compared to information highlighting other reasons to conserve, even though respondents rated the normative information as least motivating. Results show that normative messages can be a powerful lever of persuasion but that their influence is underdetected.},

Our preferences are influenced by what other people like, but depend critically on how we feel about those people, a classical psychological effect called “cognitive balance.” Here, we manipulated preferences for goods by telling participants the preferences of strongly liked or disliked groups of other people. Participants’ preferences converged to those of the liked group, but diverged from the disliked group. Activation of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ({dmPFC}) tracked the discrepancy between one’s own preference and its social ideal and was associated with subsequent preference change (toward the liked and away from the disliked group), even several months later. A follow-up study found overlapping activation in this same region of {dmPFC} with negative monetary outcomes, but no overlap with nearby activations induced by response conflict. A single social encounter can thus result in long-lasting preference change, a mechanism that recruits {dmPFC} and that may reflect the aversive nature of cognitive imbalance.},

	abstract = {Background: While smoke-free restaurant laws are intended to protect the public from secondhand smoke exposure, they may also discourage smoking among adolescents. There is no evidence from longitudinal studies to test this hypothesis.
Objective: To examine the effect of local restaurant smoking regulations on progression to established smoking among adolescents.
Design, setting, and subjects: A cohort of 2623 Massachusetts youths, ages 12–17 years at baseline, was interviewed via random digit dial telephone survey in 2001–2002 and followed up two years later. A generalised estimating equations ({GEE}) logistic regression analysis was used and controlled for potential individual, household, and town level confounding factors.
Main outcome measure: Progression to established smoking during the two year follow up period (defined as having smoked 100 or more cigarettes in one’s life).
Results: Compared to youths living in towns with weak regulations, those living in towns with strong regulations (complete restaurant smoking bans) had less than half the odds of progression to established smoking (odds ratio ({OR}) 0.39, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.24 to 0.66). The association was stronger for youths in towns with strong regulations in effect for two or more years ({OR} 0.11, 95\% {CI} 0.03 to 0.37), although it was still present for those in towns with strong regulations in effect for less than two years ({OR} 0.55, 95\% {CI} 0.33 to 0.90). No relationship was found between living in a town with a medium restaurant smoking regulation (restriction of smoking to enclosed, separately ventilated areas) and rates of progression to established smoking.
Conclusions: Local restaurant smoking bans may be an effective intervention to prevent youth smoking.},

Design: Hierarchical linear modelling ({HLM}) was used to assess the relationship between baseline strength of town-level restaurant smoking regulation and follow-up (1) perceptions of the social acceptability of smoking and (2) quitting behaviours.
Setting: Each of the 351 Massachusetts towns was classified as having strong (complete smoking ban) or weak (all other and no smoking restrictions) restaurant smoking regulations.
Subjects: 1712 adult smokers of Massachusetts aged ⩾18 years at baseline who were interviewed via random-digit-dial telephone survey in 2001–2 and followed up 2 years later.
Main outcome measures: Perceived social acceptability of smoking in restaurants and bars, and making a quit attempt and quitting smoking.
Results: Among adult smokers who had made a quit attempt at baseline, living in a town with a strong regulation was associated with a threefold increase in the odds of making a quit attempt at follow-up ({OR} = 3.12; 95\% {CI} 1.51 to 6.44). Regulation was found to have no effect on cessation at follow-up. A notable, although marginal, effect of regulation was observed for perceiving smoking in bars as socially unacceptable only among smokers who reported at baseline that smoking in bars was socially unacceptable.
Conclusions: Although local restaurant smoking regulations did not increase smoking cessation rates, they did increase the likelihood of making a quit attempt among smokers who had previously tried to quit, and seem to reinforce anti-social smoking norms among smokers who already viewed smoking in bars as socially unacceptable.},

In a recent article, Ronald Bayer (2008) argues that the mobilization of stigma may effectively reduce the prevalence of smoking behaviors linked to tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and is therefore not necessarily antithetical to public health goals. This commentary takes up this question of whether stigmatizing smoking may ultimately serve the interests of public health. Through an examination of the unique contours of tobacco control policy, we suggest that stigmatizing smoking will not ultimately help to reduce smoking prevalence amongst disadvantaged smokers – who now represent the majority of tobacco users. Rather, it is likely to exacerbate health-related inequalities by limiting smokers’ access to healthcare and inhibiting smoking cessation efforts in primary care settings.},

	abstract = {Background
Tobacco denormalization is an important concept for understanding smoking behavior. The present study sought to assess beliefs about the tobacco industry and the social acceptability of smoking among nationally representative samples of adult smokers from four countries, and to assess the relationship of these measures to cessation behavior and tobacco-control policy.
Design
A longitudinal survey of 9058 adult smokers from Canada (n =2214), the United States (n =2138), the United Kingdom (n =2401), and Australia (n =2305), was conducted in October–December 2002 and again in June and August 2003 (75\% follow-up rate). The analyses were conducted in 2005.
Results
The findings indicate that few smokers perceive approval for their smoking, and most hold relatively antagonistic beliefs toward the tobacco industry. For example, 80\% of smokers reported that society disapproves of smoking, and more than three quarters reported that tobacco companies cannot be trusted to tell the truth. Social and industry denormalization were independently associated with intentions to quit smoking. Baseline levels of social denormalization were associated with abstinence at the 8-month follow-up, as were changes in industry denormalization beliefs between baseline and follow-up. Anti-industry beliefs at baseline did not predict abstinence at follow-up. A similar pattern of findings was observed across all four countries. In addition, social denormalization and anti-industry beliefs were significantly associated with tobacco-control policies, such as noticing health warnings on packages and greater workplace smoking restrictions.
Conclusions
Tobacco denormalization constructs were independently linked to cessation-related outcomes among adults from four countries. Tobacco-industry denormalization themes in mass media campaigns may help to reduce tobacco use above and beyond more traditional communications that target social norms.},

This study tests whether there is an association between high visibility of smoking, perceived acceptability of smoking, and where youth smoke.
Methods
Surveys of 9,762 students in grades 8–10 and 1,586 parents in 15 Minnesota communities asked about the frequency of and opinions of adult and youth smoking in various indoor and outdoor public places. Chi-square analysis and {ANOVAs} compared smokers and nonsmokers.
Results
More smoking than nonsmoking youth reported often seeing adults and teens smoking in all locations. Forty-two percent of students often noticed adults and 35\% often noticed teens smoking outdoors, also the most frequent location where teens report smoking. Students perceived adult and teen smoking as more acceptable in restaurants, recreation centers, and outdoor gathering places. More student smokers than nonsmokers believe that smoking is acceptable for both adults and teens. Of the parent sample, 52\% often observed adults and 36\% often observed youth smoking outdoors. Nonsmoking parents observed adult and teen smoking more often than parents who smoke.
Conclusions
The data support an association between the frequency that youth observe smoking in various locations and the perception that smoking is socially acceptable by smoking status. Policies that restrict smoking in various locations will reduce both visibility and perceived acceptability of smoking in those locations.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Household smoking bans might decrease the visibility of cigarette smoking and communicate nonsmoking social norms and parental attitudes to youths, which may serve as mediators to reduce smoking initiation. Whether they have these effects even if parents smoke or do not otherwise communicate strong disapproval of smoking to their children is not clear. We tested these hypotheses in multi-level analyses.
Methods
A telephone survey of a random sample of 3831 Massachusetts adolescents (12–17 years) assessed respondents' perceptions of smoking prevalence and attitudes about the social acceptability of smoking in their community. The association of these outcomes with the presence of a smoking ban in the youths' home was tested in multivariate analyses that adjusted for town-level clustering and individual and environmental characteristics.
Results
A household smoking ban was reported by 71\% of all youths and 49\% of youths who lived with smokers. In multivariate models, youths who had a household smoking ban were more likely to perceive a lower adult smoking prevalence ({OR} 2.1; 95\% {CI} 1.7–2.5; P \&lt; 0.001), greater adult disapproval of adult smoking ({OR} 2.0; 1.5–2.6; P \&lt; 0.001) and of teen smoking ({OR} 1.5; 95\% {CI} 1.2–1.9; P = 0.001).
Conclusions
Among adolescents, a household smoking ban was associated with a lower perceived prevalence of adult smoking in their communities and more negative attitudes about the social acceptability of smoking, two factors that affect the likelihood of smoking initiation. Household smoking bans had these effects even in the presence of two parental factors known to encourage adolescent smoking initiation (parental smoking and lack of perceived parental disapproval of youth tobacco use). This provides an additional rationale for promoting household smoking bans to parents.},

	abstract = {Introduction Little research has been conducted to determine the psychosocial and behavioral impacts of smoke-free policies in middle-income countries.
Methods Cross-sectional data were analyzed from the 2006 waves of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation. Survey comparing adult smokers in Mexico (n = 1,080), where smoke-free legislation at that time was weak, and Uruguay (n = 1,002), where comprehensive smoke-free legislation was implemented. Analyses aimed to determine whether exposure to smoke-free policies and perceived antismoking social norms were associated with smokers’ receiving cues about the bothersome nature of secondhand smoke ({SHS}), with smokers’ reactance against such cues, and with smokers’ level of support for smoke-free policies in different venues.
Results In bivariate analyses, Uruguayan smokers were more likely than Mexican smokers to experience verbal anti-{SHS} cues, lower reactance against anti-{SHS} cues, stronger antismoking societal norms, and stronger support for 100\% smoke-free policies in enclosed workplaces, restaurants, and bars. In multivariate models for both countries, the strength of voluntary smoke-free policies at home was independently associated with support for smoke-free policies across all venues queried, except for in bars among Uruguayans. Perceived strength of familial antismoking norms was consistently associated with all indicators of the social acceptability of smoking in Uruguay but only with the frequency of receiving anti-{SHS} verbal cues in Mexico.
Discussion These results are generally consistent with previous research indicating that comprehensive smoke-free policies are likely to increase the social unacceptability of smoking and that resistance against such policies is likely to diminish once such policies are in place.},

Structural equation modelling was used to assess the direct effect of tobacco advertising and promotion on intentions at each wave, and also the indirect effect, mediated through normative influences.

Independent paths from perceived prevalence and benefits fully mediated the effects of advertising and promotion awareness on intentions mid- and post-ban. Advertising awareness indirectly affected intentions via the interaction between perceived prevalence and benefits pre-ban, whereas the indirect effect on intentions of advertising and promotion awareness was mediated by the interaction of perceived prevalence and benefits mid-ban.

Design: We used generalised estimating equations logistic regression analysis to examine the relation between regulation strength and youths’ and adults’ perceptions of adult smoking prevalence and the social acceptability of smoking in their town, while controlling for baseline anti-smoking sentiment in the town.
Setting: Each of the 351 Massachusetts towns were classified as having strong (complete smoking ban), medium (restriction of smoking to enclosed, separately ventilated areas), or weak (all others) restaurant smoking regulations.
Subjects: 1147 Massachusetts youths ages 12–17 years and 2116 adults who reported that they often or always eat out in their own town, drawn from a random digit dial survey.
Main outcome measures: Perceived adult smoking prevalence and perceived social acceptability of smoking in restaurants, in bars, or in general.
Results: Compared to youths from towns with weak regulations, youths from towns with strong regulations were more likely to perceive lower adult smoking prevalence (odds ratio ({OR}) 1.71; 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.02 to 2.84) and social unacceptability of adult smoking ({OR} 2.00, 95\% {CI} 1.29 to 3.08) in their town.

	abstract = {Background
Although neighborhoods with more collective efficacy have better health in general, recent work suggests that social norms and collective efficacy may in combination influence health behaviors such as smoking.
Methods
Using data from the New York Social Environment Study (conducted in 2005; n = 4000), we examined the separate and combined associations of neighborhood collective efficacy and anti-smoking norms with individual smoking. The outcome was current smoking, assessed using the World Mental Health Comprehensive International Diagnostic Interview ({WMH}-{CIDI}) tobacco module. Exposures of interest were neighborhood collective efficacy, measured as the average neighborhood response on a well-established scale, and neighborhood anti-smoking norms, measured as the proportion of residents who believed regular smoking was unacceptable. All analyses adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, as well as history of smoking prior to residence in the current neighborhood, individual perception of smoking level in the neighborhood, individual perception of collective efficacy, and individual smoking norms.
Results
In separate generalized estimating equation logistic regression models, neighborhood collective efficacy was not associated with smoking ({OR} 1.06, 95\% {CI} 0.84–1.34) but permissive neighborhood smoking norms were associated with more smoking ({OR} 1.34, 95\% {CI} 1.03–1.74), particularly among residents with no prior history of smoking ({OR} 2.88, 95\% {CI} 1.92–4.30). When considered in combination, where smoking norms were permissive, higher collective efficacy was associated with more smoking; in contrast, where norms were strongly anti-smoking, higher collective efficacy was associated with less smoking.
Conclusions
Features of the neighborhood social environment may need to be considered in combinations to understand their role in shaping health and health behavior.},

Methods Structural equation modeling was employed to compare differences between the two samples (507 adult smokers from Scotland and 507 from the rest of the United Kingdom) across two waves (February/March 2006 and March 2007). During these two waves, a smoking ban was introduced in Scotland but not the rest of the United Kingdom.
Results For smokers in both samples, support for smoke-free legislation at baseline significantly heightened perceived unacceptability of smoking, although perceptions of unacceptability were somewhat stronger in Scotland than the rest of the United Kingdom postban. Unlike the rest of the United Kingdom, support for a ban at baseline among smokers in Scotland was associated with higher quit intentions at follow-up. For both samples, quit intentions were significantly associated with heightened perceived unacceptability at follow-up. The overall variance explained in quit intentions was greater in Scotland than in the rest of the United Kingdom but not significantly so.
Discussion Support for smoke-free legislation at baseline significantly increased support at follow-up for both samples. However, this did not independently increase quit intentions among smokers from both Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.

This study examines whether local regulations regarding clean indoor air and youth access to tobacco are associated with residents’ subsequent perceptions of smoking norms. Data came from Massachusetts surveys of adults and youths and from records of local tobacco control policies. Indices of perceived smoking norms were based on perceived smoking prevalence and perceived community acceptance of smoking. Multilevel models tested the association between perceived norms and the presence of strong local regulations in four policy domains (restaurant smoking bans, smoking restrictions in other venues, enforcement of laws prohibiting sales to youths and youth-oriented marketing restrictions). The model controlled for town voting results on a tobacco tax referendum, which served as a measure of antismoking sentiment pre-dating the regulations. Results showed that youths perceived community norms to be significantly more ‘antismoking’ if they lived in a town that had strong regulations in at least three of the four domains. For adults, having strong regulations in as few as one to two domains was associated with perceiving community norms to be significantly more antismoking. Implementing and publicizing local regulations may help shape perceptions of community smoking norms.},

The theory of planned behaviour ({TPB}) served as the theoretical framework. Social influences were operationalised by subjective quitting norm (significant others' expectations that one should quit), descriptive quitting norm (significant others' quitting behaviour), and descriptive smoking norm (partner's smoking). Because gender differences had previously been reported, norm effects were also analysed with respect to gender. A total of 168 smokers who had a partner (47\% men, mean age M = 34, {SD} = 16) completed measures of {TPB} variables (including subjective quitting norm), descriptive quitting norm, descriptive smoking norm, and smoking behaviour. Subjective and descriptive quitting norms were more inconsistent in women than in men. The descriptive quitting norm enhanced the {TPB} prediction of intention by 5\%. A three-way interaction accounted for an additional 3\% of the variance and revealed both that subjective and descriptive quitting norms interacted in their prediction and that gender moderated this effect: the subjective quitting norm correlated positively to quitting intention only in women with a strong descriptive quitting norm. All analyses were controlled for number of cigarettes per day. These findings confirmed that it is important to distinguish subjective and descriptive norms and that differences exist in how these norms motivate women and men to quit smoking. Consistent quitting norms such as quitting of significant others in combination with their expectations that one should quit appear to be less common but more important in women to form a corresponding intention.},

This study brings together the fragmentary knowledge on social influence factors related to smoking cessation. An inventory of social influence variables shows six social influence factors. With the exception of descriptive norm, most of these are rarely studied in the context of smoking cessation.
Methods
Regression analysis on the data of 2895 smokers was used to estimate the relative importance of social influence variables as predictors of intention. The moderating effect of quit history was studied by adding interaction terms to the regression analysis.
Results
The regression analysis shows that subjective norm and injunctive norm, that is, the social norms on what ought to be done, are more important than descriptive norms, that is, the perceived smoking and smoking cessation behavior of others. This holds especially for smokers whose past cessation attempts quickly failed. Most smokers think that it is acceptable to smoke in most social situations, but simultaneously think that other people approve it if they quit smoking.
Conclusions
Results suggest that health campaigns should incite social interaction to increase smokers' awareness of social norms on the proper behavior. Also, studies into smoking cessation should take account of the various social influence factors outlined in this study.},

These trends project 65 million more obese adults in the {USA} and 11 million more obese adults in the {UK} by 2030, consequently accruing an additional 6–8·5 million cases of diabetes, 5·7–7·3 million cases of heart disease and stroke, 492 000–669 000 additional cases of cancer, and 26–55 million quality-adjusted life years forgone for {USA} and {UK} combined. The combined medical costs associated with treatment of these preventable diseases are estimated to increase by \$48–66 billion/year in the {USA} and by £1·9–2 billion/year in the {UK} by 2030. Hence, effective policies to promote healthier weight also have economic benefits.},

Previous comparable estimates of the economic costs of poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol and overweight/obesity were based on economic data from 1992–93.
Methods Diseases associated with poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol and overweight/obesity were identified. Risk factor-specific population attributable fractions for these diseases were applied to disease-specific estimates of the economic cost to the {NHS} in the {UK} in 2006–07.
Results In 2006–07, poor diet-related ill health cost the {NHS} in the {UK} £5.8 billion. The cost of physical inactivity was £0.9 billion. Smoking cost was £3.3 billion, alcohol cost £3.3 billion, overweight and obesity cost £5.1 billion.
Conclusion The estimates of the economic cost of risk factors for chronic disease presented here are based on recent financial data and are directly comparable. They suggest that poor diet is a behavioural risk factor that has the highest impact on the budget of the {NHS}, followed by alcohol consumption, smoking and physical inactivity.},

	abstract = {Objective
To examine the links between three fundamental healthy lifestyle behaviors (not smoking, healthy diet, and adequate physical activity) and all-cause mortality in a national sample of adults in the United States.
Method
We used data from 8375 U.S. participants aged ≥ 20 years of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2002 who were followed through 2006.
Results
During a mean follow-up of 5.7 years, 745 deaths occurred. Compared with their counterparts, the risk for all-cause mortality was reduced by 56\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 35\%–70\%) among adults who were nonsmokers, 47\% (95\% {CI}: 36\%, 57\%) among adults who were physically active, and 26\% (95\% {CI}: 4\%, 42\%) among adults who consumed a healthy diet. Compared with participants who had no healthy behaviors, the risk decreased progressively as the number of healthy behaviors increased. Adjusted hazard ratios and 95\% confidence interval were 0.60 (0.38, 0.95), 0.45 (0.30, 0.67), and 0.18 (0.11, 0.29) for 1, 2, and 3 healthy behaviors, respectively.
Conclusion
Adults who do not smoke, consume a healthy diet, and engage in sufficient physical activity can substantially reduce their risk for early death.},

	abstract = {Background
Major questions remain unanswered about how best to accomplish multiple behavior change. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether there are differences in successfully changing multiple behaviors in computer-tailored sequential and simultaneous interventions for physical activity ({PA}) promotion and fat intake ({FI}) reduction.
Methods
Participants (N = 567) were randomly assigned to receive an intervention for {PA} and {FI} simultaneously; {PA} at baseline and {FI} at 3 months; or {FI} at baseline and {PA} at 3 months. Successful behavior change at 6 months was defined as: \&gt; 60 min {PA} increase and/or 5\% {FI} reduction. Using multinomial logistic regression the odds ratios of successful behaviors change (none, {PA} only, {FI} only, or both) were determined for intervention mode, gender, age, {BMI} and education.
Results
Overall drop-out was 26\%. There was no behavior change for 20.2\% of participants; 30.5\% successfully decreased {FI}; 15.8\% successfully increased {PA}; 33.5\% successfully changed both behaviors. Intervention mode, gender and age were not associated with successful behavior change. Compared to those that did not change any behaviors: participants that successfully changed {FI} were more likely to be overweight/obese ({OR} = 1.85); and participants that successfully changed both behaviors were more likely to be overweight/obese ({OR} = 2.13) and have lower education ({OR} = 2.46).
Conclusions
Success in changing multiple behaviors was not associated with intervention mode; both simultaneous and sequential interventions can be applied. Being overweight might be an extra motivator to change health behaviors.},

This involves component processes, including cognitive perspective taking (cognitive {ToM}) and understanding emotions (affective {ToM}). This study assessed the distinction and overlap of neural processes involved in these respective components, and also investigated their development between adolescence and adulthood. While data suggest that {ToM} develops between adolescence and adulthood, these populations have not been compared on cognitive and affective {ToM} domains. Using {fMRI} with 15 adolescent (aged 11–16 years) and 15 adult (aged 24–40 years) males, we assessed neural responses during cartoon vignettes requiring cognitive {ToM}, affective {ToM} or physical causality comprehension (control). An additional aim was to explore relationships between {fMRI} data and self-reported empathy. Both cognitive and affective {ToM} conditions were associated with neural responses in the classic {ToM} network across both groups, although only affective {ToM} recruited medial/ventromedial {PFC} ({mPFC}/{vmPFC}). Adolescents additionally activated {vmPFC} more than did adults during affective {ToM}. The specificity of the {mPFC}/{vmPFC} response during affective {ToM} supports evidence from lesion studies suggesting that {vmPFC} may integrate affective information during {ToM}. Furthermore, the differential neural response in {vmPFC} between adult and adolescent groups indicates developmental changes in affective {ToM} processing.},

	abstract = {Summary Background: A study conducted in 1983 to identify and rank the symptoms experienced by patients receiving cancer chemotherapy reported that vomiting and nausea were the most important symptoms experienced. With the advent of new antiemetic regimens and changes in cancer chemotherapy, it was anticipated that changes may have occurred in patient perception of symptoms. The study was therefore repeated in 1993.
Patients and methods: One hundred and fifty-five cancer patients receiving chemotherapy at a large urban teaching hospital participated in the study. Patients selected from cards listing symptoms all those experienced and the five most troublesome.
Results: Patients reported experiencing an average of 20 symptoms (13 physical and 7 psychosocial). Nausea was reported as the most severe symptom followed by tiredness and loss of hair. Vomiting, which was the most severe symptom in 1983, now ranked 5th. Differences were detected in the symptoms experienced and reported as most severe, between chemotherapy regimens, between older and younger patients and between males and females.
Conclusions: The results suggest a reduction in the severity of some symptoms experienced while receiving chemotherapy and a shift from concerns about physical to psychosocial issues.},

Three further propositions focus on the inter-relatedness of prosocial orientations (Proposition 3), the social development of prosocial orientation (Propositions 4 and 5), and situational and dispositional views of interpersonal orientations (Proposition 6). Evidence in support of these propositions, especially the latter three propositions, is evaluated by classic and/or recent research.

We argue that in many cases the neural processes in one brain are coupled to the neural processes in another brain via the transmission of a signal through the environment.

The neurological data is consistent with a priori developed hypotheses regarding different behavioral strategies, and suggest that extrinsically motivated proself strategies are driven by calculation and a situation-by-situation approach. Increased activation was found in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus ({STS}), and precuneus.

	abstract = {Parochial altruism—a preference for altruistic behavior towards ingroup members and mistrust or hostility towards outgroup members—is a pervasive feature in human society and strongly shapes the enforcement of social norms. Since the uniqueness of human society critically depends on the enforcement of norms, the understanding of the neural circuitry of the impact of parochial altruism on social norm enforcement is key, but unexplored. To fill this gap, we measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) while subjects had the opportunity to punish ingroup members and outgroup members for violating social norms. Findings revealed that subjects' strong punishment of defecting outgroup members is associated with increased activity in a functionally connected network involved in sanction-related decisions (right orbitofrontal gyrus, right lateral prefrontal cortex, right dorsal caudatus). Moreover, the stronger the connectivity in this network, the more outgroup members are punished. In contrast, the much weaker punishment of ingroup members who committed the very same norm violation is associated with increased activity and connectivity in the mentalizing-network (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporo-parietal junction), as if subjects tried to understand or justify ingroup members' behavior. Finally, connectivity analyses between the two networks suggest that the mentalizing-network modulates punishment by affecting the activity in the right orbitofrontal gyrus and right lateral prefrontal cortex, notably in the same areas showing enhanced activity and connectivity whenever third-parties strongly punished defecting outgroup members.

However, the brain bases of {ToM} are most frequently measured via explicit laboratory tasks that pose direct questions about mental states (e.g. “In this story, what does Steve think Julia believes?”). Neuroanatomical measures may provide a way to explore the brain bases of individual differences in more naturalistic everyday mentalizing. In the current study, we examined the relation between cortical thickness and spontaneous {ToM} using the novel Spontaneous Theory of Mind Protocol ({STOMP}), which measures participants’ spontaneous descriptions of the beliefs, emotions and goals of characters in naturalistic videos. We administered standard {ToM} tasks and the {STOMP} to young adults (aged 18–26 years) and collected structural magnetic resonance imaging data from a subset of these participants. The {STOMP} produced robust individual variability and was correlated with performance on traditional {ToM} tasks. Further, unlike the traditional {ToM} tasks, {STOMP} performance was related to cortical thickness for a set of brain regions that have been functionally linked to {ToM} processing. These findings offer novel insight into the brain bases of variability in naturalistic mentalizing performance, with implications for both typical and atypical populations.},

We measured brain activity using functional {MRI} while participants chose between two lotteries: in the private condition, they observed the outcome of the unchosen lottery, and in the social condition, the outcome of the lottery chosen by another person. The striatum, a reward-related brain structure, showed higher activity when participants won more than their counterpart (social gains) compared with winning in isolation and lower activity when they won less than their counterpart (social loss) compared with private loss. The medial prefrontal cortex, implicated in social reasoning, was more activated by social gains than all other events. Sensitivity to social gains influenced both brain activity and behavior during subsequent choices. Specifically, striatal activity associated with social gains predicted medial prefrontal cortex activity during social choices, and experienced social gains induced more risky and competitive behavior in later trials. These results show that interplay between reward and social reasoning networks mediates the influence of social comparison on the decision process.},

This ‘hyperacuity’ seems to be at odds with the common assumption that the {fMRI} signal has a low spatial resolution due to the spatial spread of the underlying hemodynamic events. To resolve this apparent contradiction, I checked a very straightforward prediction of the hyperacuity hypothesis: if multivariate analyses are picking up a small-scale functional organization, then it can be expected that smoothing will be detrimental to the ability to decode these fine-scale spatial signals. I tested this prediction using data obtained with two paradigms to which multivariate techniques have been applied previously, including the decoding of grating orientation from the pattern of activity in primary visual cortex. It was found that smoothing does not decrease the sensitivity of multivariate analyses. Further simulations in which the scale of cortical organization was known indicate that this effect of smoothing contradicts the idea that the patterns detected with multivariate techniques reflect a fine-scale spatial organization.},

	shorttitle = {How does an {fMRI} voxel sample the neuronal activity pattern},
	abstract = {Recent studies suggested that {fMRI} voxel patterns can convey information represented in columnar-scale neuronal population codes, even when spatial resolution is insufficient to directly image the patterns of columnar selectivity (Kamitani and Tong, 2005; Haynes and Rees, 2005). Sensitivity to subvoxel-scale pattern information, or “{fMRI} hyperacuity,” would greatly enhance the power of {fMRI} when combined with pattern information analysis techniques (Kriegeskorte and Bandettini, 2007). An individual voxel might weakly reflect columnar-level information if the columns within its boundaries constituted a slightly unbalanced sample of columnar selectivities (Kamitani and Tong, 2005), providing a possible mechanism for {fMRI} hyperacuity. However, Op de Beeck (2009) suggests that a coarse-scale neuronal organization rather than {fMRI} hyperacuity may explain the presence of the information in the {fMRI} patterns. Here we argue (a) that the present evidence does not rule out {fMRI} hyperacuity, (b) that the mechanism originally suggested for {fMRI} hyperacuity (biased sampling by averaging within each voxel's boundaries; Kamitani and Tong, 2005) will only produce very weak sensitivity to fine-grained pattern information, and (c) that an alternative mechanism (voxel as complex spatiotemporal filter) is physiologically more accurate and promises stronger sensitivity to fine-grained pattern information: We know that each voxel samples the neuronal activity pattern through a unique fine-grained structure of venous vessels that supply its blood oxygen level-dependent signal. At the simplest level, the drainage domain of a venous vessel may sample the neuronal pattern with a selectivity bias (Gardner, 2009; Shmuel et al., 2009). Beyond biased drainage domains, we illustrate with a simple simulation how temporal properties of the hemodynamics (e.g., the speed of the blood in the capillary bed) can shape spatial properties of a voxel's filter (e.g., how finely structured it is). This suggests that a voxel, together with its signal-supplying vasculature, may best be thought of as a complex spatiotemporal filter. Such a filter may well have greater sensitivity to high spatial frequencies than the Gaussian or averaging-box kernels typically invoked to characterize voxel sampling (compact kernels, both of which would act like anti-aliasing filters that minimize such sensitivity). Importantly, the complex-spatiotemporal-filter hypothesis of {fMRI} hyperacuity can account for the observed robustness to slight shifts of the voxel grid caused by head motion: Because the fine-grained components of the filter are vascular, they will remain in a constant relationship to the neuronal patterns sampled as the voxel grid is slightly shifted.},

Using statistical algorithms to classify brain states, we found that ensemble {fMRI} signals in early visual areas could reliably predict on individual trials which of eight stimulus orientations the subject was seeing. Moreover, when subjects had to attend to one of two overlapping orthogonal gratings, feature-based attention strongly biased ensemble activity toward the attended orientation. These results demonstrate that {fMRI} activity patterns in early visual areas, including primary visual cortex (V1), contain detailed orientation information that can reliably predict subjective perception. Our approach provides a framework for the readout of fine-tuned representations in the human brain and their subjective contents.},

Here we describe how such distorted results can occur, using both schematic illustrations and examples from actual {fMRI} datasets. We recommend that confirmatory and sensitivity tests, such as the ones prescribed here, should be considered a necessary stage of searchlight analysis interpretation, and that their adoption will allow the full potential of searchlight analysis to be realized.},

Such rapidly achieved success is bound to evoke skepticism. A degree of skepticism toward new methods and ideas is both inevitable and useful in any field. It is especially valuable in a science as young as cognitive neuroscience and its even younger siblings, social and affective neuroscience. Healthy skepticism encourages us to check our assumptions, recognize the limitations of our methods, and proceed thoughtfully. Skepticism itself, however, also must be examined. In this article, I review the most commonly voiced criticisms of functional neuroimaging. In the spirit of healthy skepticism, I will critically examine these criticisms themselves.

Using a survey of young adults, we examine the relationship between these motivations and the frequency of passing along online content. We also investigate if high trait curiosity can indirectly lead to more forwarding by increasing the amount of online content consumed. Results show that Internet users, who are more individualistic and/or more altruistic, tend to forward more online content than others.},
